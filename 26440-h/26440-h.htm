<h2><a name="EDITORS_PREFACE" id="EDITORS_PREFACE"></a>EDITOR'S PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The appearance at the beginning of last year, in the Annual
Report of the Institution of Civil Engineers for 1861 and
1862, of a short memoir of Mr. Braidwood, suggested the
publication of a more extended account of the life of the
late head of the London Fire Brigade, combined with his
opinions upon the subject of his profession.</p>

<p>These opinions are comprised in a work on "Fire Engines,
and the Training of Firemen," published in Edinburgh in
1830; two papers upon cognate subjects read before the
Institution of Civil Engineers, two similar papers read before
the Society of Arts, and in a variety of reports upon public
buildings, warehouses, &amp;c. While regretting the great loss
that the public has sustained, in being deprived by Mr.
Braidwood's sudden death of a complete record of his long
and varied London experience, it has been considered advisable
to republish the above materials arranged in a
systematic form, omitting only such parts as the Author's
more matured experience rendered desirable, but confining
the whole to his own words.</p>

<h4>OF</h4>

<h2>JAMES BRAIDWOOD.</h2>


<p>The history of mankind, from the earliest times, has been
one of alternate peace and war with fire. The immeasurable
value of its obedience, and the fearful consequences of its
insubordination, have, in all ages, made its due subjection
one of the most important conditions of even human existence
itself. As camps and trading stations grew into populous
cities, the dangers of fire were both multiplied and
aggravated. Its ravages in the ancient capitals of the world
are matters of history; and it is established that something
like organization was extended to the means then employed
for suppressing conflagrations. Even the fire-engine itself,
in a practicable, although imperfect form, was described and
illustrated by a sectional working drawing, by Hero of
Alexandria, in a book written by him more than one hundred
years before the Christian era. In its many translations,
from the original Greek into Latin and into modern
tongues, Hero's book, with its remarkable series of drawings,
still occupies a place in the mechanical literature of our
own time. But, although the construction of the fire-engine
was thus known two thousand years ago, we have no
actual evidence of its use until within the last two centuries;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and within the whole compass of English history, at
least, we know that nothing like discipline and organization,
in the modern sense of the terms, were introduced into the
management of fire apparatus until a time quite within the
recollection of the middle-aged men of our own day. If
there be anything apparently improbable in this fact, we
need only recollect that many of the grandest triumphs of
human genius, with which we are already so familiar, are not
yet forty years old. The modern system of English fire brigades
belongs wholly to the period of railways, steam navigation,
and electric telegraphs, and it owes nearly all to the genius
and disciplined heroism of a single individual, James Braidwood,
who, but little more than four years ago, fell&mdash;as
nobly for himself as sadly for others&mdash;at his chosen post of
duty. What, when he first gave his energies&mdash;indeed, his
whole heart to it, was but the rough and unskilful employment
of the fireman, became under Mr. Braidwood's command
and his infusing spirit of order and intelligence, as
distinguished from reckless daring, a noble pursuit, almost
rising in dignity to a profession, and indeed acknowledged
as such by many, and significantly, although indirectly, by
Royalty itself.</p>

<p>Until the year 1833, not only the parish engines of the
metropolis, numbering, as they did, about three hundred, but
the engines also of the Fire Insurance Companies, were comparatively
inefficient and often out of order, while they were
also under the most diverse, if not irresponsible management.
There were no really trained firemen, and those who controlled
and worked the engines were oftener in antagonism
with each other than acting in concert. The parish engines
were in the care of the beadles, and in one case a beadle's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
widow, Mrs. Smith, for some years commanded one of the
city engines. The energies of each band of firemen were
commonly reserved for the protection of property only in
which their own insurance company or parish was immediately
interested. As a rule, whatever water was thrown
upon a burning building was dashed against the walls, windows,
and roof from the outside only, very little if any
really reaching the actual seat of the fire within. As a consequence,
fires, which are now quickly "got under," were
then left to burn themselves out, the spreading of the fire
being prevented either by deluging the contiguous buildings
with water, or by pulling them down altogether.</p>

<p>James Braidwood was born in Edinburgh in the year
1800. His father was a well-known upholsterer and builder,
who appears to have chosen for his son the profession of a surveyor.
To this end he was entered at the High School, then
under the rectorship of Mr. (afterwards Professor) Pillans, and
here, and subsequently under private masters, the youth
received a sound education in the branches most appropriate
to his intended pursuit in life. He was for some time engaged
in his father's business, and thereby gained an amount
of practical knowledge, which was of, perhaps, as much service
to him in his subsequent career as a fireman, as it would
have been had he adopted the profession originally chosen
for him. Young Braidwood was an apt student, a fact, perhaps,
sufficiently attested afterwards by his successful authorship,
at the age of thirty, of the only English work then
extant upon the fire-engine and its proper management. He
read much, wrote well, was a good draughtsman, and had a
sound knowledge of mechanics. But whether his powers
required wider scope than a surveyor's practice could offer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
or whether, more than forty years ago, and in Edinburgh,
the chances of professional success were very much less than
now, James Braidwood soon turned his mind to what
became the great work of his life. He was becoming known
for activity and a high order of personal courage, and there
were those in place and power who saw in him the other
elements of character which go to make a successful leader
of men. He was soon, and when but twenty-three years of
age, made the superintendent of the Edinburgh fire engines,
and he almost as soon began to reform their inefficient and
vicious system of management. He had held his post but
three weeks, however, when the series of fires broke forth
which still bear the name of the Great Fire of Edinburgh.
Many of the old and lofty houses in the High Street were
destroyed, between four and five hundred families were
made houseless, ten persons were either killed outright or
fatally injured, and for several days nearly the whole of the
High Street, if not the larger part of the old town, was
threatened with destruction. Never were the consequences
of want of organization more conspicuous. There was no
real command, for there were none to obey; and while those
who might have stopped the flames at the outset, wasted
their own energies in random efforts, or, perhaps, fell to
quarrelling among themselves, the fearful devastation rolled
on. The occasion was sufficient to induce the authorities
and insurance companies to listen to and profit by Mr.
Braidwood's recommendations. They consented to bear in
common the expenses necessary to organize and maintain an
efficient brigade. This was soon formed of picked men,
who, although daily engaged in their former ordinary occupations,
were regularly inspected, trained, and exercised early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
in one morning of every week. Fires were becoming more
and more numerous year by year; but the influence of the
improved system was soon felt. The men were taught to
improve to the utmost the first few minutes after an alarm
was given, and by constant emulation and discipline, a spirit
of wonderful readiness was cultivated in them. They were
trained to seek out and follow up the source of a fire before
it had had time to spread, and to throw the water from the
engines directly upon it, instead of wastefully, if not injuriously
about. The result was, that while out of forty-eight
fires which happened in the first year of the history of the
brigade, eleven proved total losses, and twelve "considerable"
losses, the number of total losses decreased rapidly, year
by year, while the whole number of "calls" was almost
as rapidly increasing. Thus in the second year of the
brigade there were eighty "calls," of which seven were
total, and eighteen considerable losses. In the next
three years, with from ninety-four to one hundred and
ninety-four "calls" yearly, there was but one total loss
in each year, and but from nine to eighteen "considerable"
losses.</p>

<p>Mr. Braidwood was meanwhile improving the fire-escapes,
and when new engines were added to the force, he procured
better workmanship. By his personal influence, also, more
than by the mere advantage of official position, Mr. Braidwood
secured the constant co-operation of the police in
giving the earliest alarms of fire, and in facilitating the
labours of the firemen when actually on duty. As has just
been shown, the results of method, applied skill, and of a
personal devotion cultivated under the high impulse of immediate
public observation and approval, were soon manifest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
To this vast improvement the <i>Edinburgh Mercury</i>, as representing
the opinion of the citizens of the Scottish capital,
bore public testimony in its issue of August 14, 1828, when
the Fire Brigade of that city had been tested by nearly
five years of constant trial, and with conspicuous success.
Referring to the excellent organization of the establishment,
it was remarked that there were then but few, if any, serious
fires in Edinburgh, for when a fire broke out&mdash;and the
alarms were as frequent as ever&mdash;it was speedily checked.
Said the writer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Not only is the apparatus constructed on the best
possible principles, but the whole system of operations has
been changed. The public, however, do not see the same
bustle, or hear the same noise as formerly; and hence they
seem erroneously to conclude that there is nothing done.
The fact is, the spectator sees the preparation for action
made, but he sees no more. Where the strength of the men
and the supply of water used to be wasted, by being thrown
against windows, walls, and roofs, the firemen now seek out
the spot where the danger lies, and creeping on hands and
feet into a chamber full of flame, or smoke, often at the
hazard of suffocation, discover the exact seat of danger;
and, by bringing the water in contact with it, obtain immediate
mastery over the powerful element with which they
have to contend. In this daring and dangerous work men
have occasionally fainted from heat, or dropped down from
want of respiration, in which cases the next person at hand
is always ready to assist his companion, and to release him
from his service of danger."</p></div>

<p>In a fire which happened while Mr. Braidwood was at the
head of the Edinburgh Brigade, he won great admiration by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
bringing out from the burning building a quantity of gunpowder
which was known to be stored there. He would
not ask any of his men to undertake this dangerous feat,
but, amidst the breathless suspense of thousands of spectators,
he coolly searched for and safely carried out, first one,
and then a second, cask of this explosive material. Had
the fire reached the powder, it was known that the worst
consequences of the conflagration would have been immensely
increased.</p>

<p>The fame of the Edinburgh Brigade rapidly spread
throughout the kingdom, and it gradually became regarded as
a model to which all other organizations for the suppression
of fires would ultimately be made to conform. As a response
to constant inquiries from a distance, Mr. Braidwood, in
1829, forwarded to the Society of Arts, London, a description
of his chain-ladder fire-escape. For this invaluable
apparatus, which had already effected a considerable saving
of life, the Society's Silver Medal was awarded, and, accompanying
the award, the Council of the Society extended an
invitation to the author to "give a complete account of his
mode of drilling firemen, and combining the use of fire-escapes
with the ordinary fire-engine service." Responding
to this invitation, Mr. Braidwood in the following year
published his work "On the Construction of Fire-Engines
and Apparatus, the Training of Firemen, and the Method
of Proceeding in Cases of Fire." From this work, which
may still be regarded as an authority, extensive extracts
have been made in the subsequent chapters of the present
volume, and it need not, therefore, be further referred to
here than to say that it formed a thoroughly original
account of an original system, and that its illustrations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
which were especially clear, were drawn by the author's
own hand. This work attracted much attention from
municipal bodies and insurance companies throughout the
kingdom, and more than one official deputation visited
Edinburgh to learn from Mr. Braidwood himself the details
of a system which was already working such important
results. In London, especially, three West India warehouses
had been burnt in the year 1829, with a loss of
300,000<i>l</i>.; and with the extending use of gas, the increasing
frequency of fires, and the conspicuous inefficiency of the
parish engines, and the want of unity of action among the
insurance companies, it was felt that what had answered so
well in Edinburgh would prove still more valuable in the
metropolis. The general estimation in which Mr. Braidwood's
services were then held may be considered as expressed
in the following, among other contemporary reviews
of his book:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Edinburgh Fire-engine Establishment is now all
but perfect. A unity of system has been accomplished, and
a corps of firemen mustered, who, in point of physical vigour
and moral intrepidity, are all entitled to be denominated
chosen men. At the head of this band stands Mr. Braidwood,
an individual who has on several occasions given
abundant evidence of promptitude in extremity, and a noble
contempt of personal danger, and whose enthusiasm, in what
we may call his profession, could not have been more
strikingly exemplified than by his illustrating it in the
manner we now see before us. It is the only book we are
acquainted with that treats of the systematic training of
firemen; and from the perspicuity of its details, it must
necessarily become the manual of all such institutions, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
ought to find a place in every insurance office in the United
Kingdom."</p></div>

<p>It had been from time to time attempted to bring the
fire apparatus of the London Insurance Companies under a
single management; but it was nearly ten years after the
establishment of the Edinburgh Fire Brigade, and only when
Mr. Braidwood himself had been invited to come to London,
that this was at last effected. As for the parish engines,
they were wholly neglected under this arrangement, and,
indeed, a great number of them had been already allowed to
fall into disuse, as far as could be permitted without incurring
the penalties of the Statutes of 1774. On the
1st January, 1833, at the instance of Mr. Ford, of the Sun
Fire-office, eight of the insurance companies formed an association
of fire-engines and firemen, each company withholding
its own distinctive name and badges from the united
force. This was known as the London Fire-engine Establishment.
It was supported by the companies in common,
each in proportion to the premiums received from its business
in London, a minimum rate being fixed. Each company
contributing to the support of the establishment nominated
one member of the committee of management. This association
existed for thirty-three years, when on the 1st of
January, 1866, the Metropolitan Board of Works took
charge of the fire-engines and the general fire establishment
of the metropolis. Mr. Braidwood took the command of
the London Brigade thus formed at the onset. The Edinburgh
Fire-engine Committee, on accepting his resignation,
presented him with a gold watch, and a vote of thanks,
"for the singularly indefatigable manner in which he had
discharged the duties of his important office, not merely by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
his extraordinary exertions on occasions of emergency, but
for the care and attention he had bestowed on the training
of the firemen, whereby the establishment had been
brought to its present high state of efficiency." He had
previously received from the men under him a handsome
silver cup, bearing the following inscription:&mdash;"Presented
to Mr. James Braidwood, by the City of Edinburgh Firemen,
as a token of their admiration of him as their leader,
and of deep respect for him as a gentleman."</p>

<p>As in Edinburgh, the London Fire Brigade under Mr.
Braidwood's superintendence became a new force, and in
every respect a remarkable organization. Where the inefficiency
of the old firemen could not at once be made to yield
to discipline, they were pensioned off; and within a short
time a select band of active, hardy, and thoroughly trained
men was formed. In 1834, the second year of Mr. Braidwood's
superintendence, the Houses of Parliament were
burnt; and a most destructive fire occurred also at Mile-end.
The first-named fire created general consternation, and there
are many persons who can still recollect that also at Mile-end.
These great fires stimulated Mr. Braidwood to increased
exertions, and the result was soon visible in the lessened proportion
of totally destroyed premises to the whole number
of fires. The brigade had, of course, no power of prevention,
and alarms of fire were becoming more numerous than ever.
The use of friction matches and of gas was increasing enormously;
manufactures, and the steam-engines and machinery
for conducting them, were being rapidly multiplied; and with
the vast progress making in the production of cotton goods,
the use of cotton curtains and bed-furniture was becoming
common in dwellings forming a large proportion of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
metropolis, but in which, not long before, such articles were
either regarded as luxuries or were altogether unknown.
The total number of fires attended by the brigade in the
year 1833, exclusive of chimneys on fire, was 458, while in
1851 the number had risen to 928; and although London had
been growing all this time, it had not doubled in size to
correspond with the increased number of fires. But while the
total yearly number of fires, since the formation of the
brigade, has shown a large and hardly interrupted increase,
the number of cases of total destruction has almost as steadily
diminished. Thus, "totally destroyed" was reported of 31
fires in the year 1833, whereas in 1839 there were but 17
cases, and the average for twenty-one years, from 1833 to
1853 inclusive, was but 25-1/2 yearly, while at the present
time, with all the vast growth of London, the average, under
the continuance of Mr. Braidwood's system, is hardly if at all
greater.</p>

<p>Mr. Braidwood from the first exhibited excellent judgment
in his choice of men to serve under him. He chose sailors,
as a rule, as being accustomed to obedience, and to irregular
and prolonged duty, while also they were especially hardy
and active; and where there was especial danger which must
be met, he was always ready to lead, and his men had soon
learned to confide in his quick and sound judgment in emergency,
knowing that he would never permit them to incur
needless risk. His own iron constitution, and his habits of
constant vigilance, served as a high standard and incentive to
those about him; and thus it was, by selection, discipline,
and example, resting upon a foundation of even paternal
kindness, that the men of the London Fire Brigade became
conspicuous for their courage, energy, hardihood, and unalterable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
devotion to duty. The brigade, too, was most popular
with the public, and could always count upon any necessary
assistance in their labours. The system of rewards given to
whoever was the first to bring a call of fire, the liberal gratuity
to the policeman who first reached the burning premises,
there preventing undue confusion, and by keeping the street-door
closed, shutting off a strong draught of air from the
flames, and the handsome pay to the ready throng of strong-armed
men who worked the engines, secured every co-operation
from the public, beyond that naturally springing from
a general admiration of so brave and well-trained a body of
men.</p>

<p>Mr. Braidwood's residence was at the principal station of
the Fire-engine Establishment in Watling-street. To this
station came all alarms of fire. He attended in person all calls
from leading thoroughfares, public buildings, or localities
where a serious conflagration might be expected. In the
night a call was announced to him through a speaking-tube
reaching to his bedside. The gas in his room was always
burning, and he would quickly decide, from the known locality
of the fire, and from the report given, whether he need
go himself. In any case, his men were awake and quickly
away. Rapidity in dressing, and in horseing and mounting
the engines, was but a detail of daily drill. The moment the
scene of action was reached, nothing was allowed to stand in
the way of access to the actual seat of the fire, and nothing
either in securing a supply of water. The inmates of the
premises, if any, were quickly got out, and wherever an unhappy
creature was cut off by the flames, there were always
one or more firemen ready, if necessary, to brave an apparently
certain death in a heroic attempt at rescue&mdash;an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
attempt, indeed, which but seldom failed. It is but just to
say here that the firemen were always nobly seconded, if not
indeed anticipated, in these attempts by the officers and men
of the Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire&mdash;a
body which has long rendered priceless services to humanity
under most appalling circumstances. The men of the Fire
Brigade were taught to prevent, as much as possible, the
access of air to the burning materials. What the open door
of the ash pit is to the furnace of a steam-boiler the open
street door is to the house on fire. In both cases the door gives
vital air to the flames. The men of the Brigade were trained
to pursue a fire, not yet under full headway, up-stairs and
down, in at windows and out through the roof, anywhere, so
it could be reached directly by the water from the engines.
They were made to regard it as worse than a waste to throw
even a gallon of water upon a dead wall or upon a surface of
slate or plaster, so long as by any means the branch pipe
could be got to bear upon the seat of the fire itself. The
statistics of the operations of the London Fire-engine Establishment
from 1833 to the present time, show with what
success the system originated and so admirably carried out
by Mr Braidwood has been pursued. Of the whole number
of fires not one in fifty now proceeds to the extent of total
destruction of the premises.</p>

<p>Previous to the organization of the Fire-engine Establishment
there were no official annual reports of the fires in the
metropolis. No one person by himself was indeed in a position
to know all of the fires that happened, any more than,
but for Lloyds', could we know of all the wrecks which take
place around and upon our coasts. It was impossible, under
such a state of things, that either the value of insurance to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the insured or its risk to the insurer could be rightly known.
The general public could only know that, like fevers and
certain other classes of disease, fires were always breaking
out, but no one could know, even approximately, how great
or how little was the real general risk. When, however, a
fire establishment was formed, the engines were called to all
fires, whether of insured or uninsured property. It was not
now difficult to tabulate the number and localities of fires; but
Mr. Braidwood went further, and extended his yearly tables
to include the various causes of fires, and the classification of
the premises, whether residences, shops, warehouses, manufactories,
&amp;c., where they occurred, the subdivision of these
classes being extended to every variety of occupation and
business. Even the hours at which the various fires broke
out were carefully tabulated, and thus the particulars of
London fires soon became an important branch of statistics,
from which the operations of insurance have derived increased
certainty, with greater economy to the insured.</p>

<p>Although regarding the training and discipline of firemen
as of the first importance in the organization of a fire
brigade, Mr. Braidwood gave a large share of attention to
the improvement of fire-engines and their kindred appliances.
While in Edinburgh, where the steepness of many
of the streets, and the roughness of the pavements in the
older parts of the town prevented the rapid and easy movement
of heavy engines, he recommended and adopted a
lighter description, but in London he recognised the necessity
for greater power. Mr. Tilley, then a fire-engine maker
in the Blackfriars'-road, ably seconded his efforts, and at
length the distinctive type known as the London Fire
Brigade Engine was produced, and which, weighing about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
eighteen cwt. when ready for service, would throw eighty-eight
gallons of water per minute, and, in short trials, as
much as 120 gallons in the same time. This engine was
mounted upon springs, and in strength and ease of working
presented a marked improvement upon those which had
preceded it. Its ordinary working complement of men
was twenty-eight, and larger engines, upon the same general
design, have since been made, to be worked by from forty-five
to sixty men. The steam fire-engine has already,
to a certain extent, superseded the brigade engine, but
the latter is still likely, for some time at least, to be preferred
for a large class of fires, both in London and in the
provinces.</p>

<p>Mr. Braidwood at an early date adopted the ordinary military
scaling ladders to the purposes of his brigade, two being
placed on each engine, and at his recommendation ladders
were also placed on a two-wheeled carriage as a convenient
fire-escape. He also induced the Admiralty, in 1841,
to adopt hose-reels in the various dockyards, these implements
having been previously in successful use in New
York. In 1848 he was induced, in consequence of the
large number of small fires to which his engines were
called out, to adopt a small hand-pump as an auxiliary to
the fire-engine. This could be rapidly brought to bear,
and although worked by but one man, the value of a small
quantity of water thrown directly upon the seat of a small
fire was found to be greater than that of perhaps twenty
times as much when thrown about in the ordinary manner.
It was of great importance also in warehouses stored with
valuable goods, to throw the least necessary quantity of
water upon a fire. These hand-pumps still form an important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
part of the present apparatus of the brigade, and
they have been widely adopted elsewhere.</p>

<p>London, unlike Edinburgh, has a vast water-side property,
always exposed to danger from fire. Almost immediately,
therefore, after having taken the command of the London
Brigade, Mr. Braidwood directed his attention to the construction
of improved floating fire-engines, to be moored in
the river, where they would be always available for the
protection of wharf property. Two were constructed, one
being a machine of great power, with pumps made to be
worked by 120 men. These machines proved of great
value. In 1852, shortly after the memorable fire at
Humphrey's warehouses, he persuaded the Fire-engine
Committee to allow one of these engines to be altered so
as to work by steam, and in 1855 a large self-propelling
floating steam fire-engine was made upon a novel construction,
and which, having already rendered great service at
fires on the river side, still ranks as the most powerful
machine in the service of the brigade. With locomotive
boilers and large double steam engines, this float can steam
nine miles an hour, and when in place at a fire it can throw
four streams of water, each from a jet-pipe of 1-1/2 inch in
diameter, to a great distance. In the great fire of 1861,
this floating engine was worked with but little intermission
for upwards of a fortnight. In 1860 Mr. Braidwood obtained
the sanction of the Fire-engine Committee for the introduction
of a land steam fire-engine, and although he did not
live to witness the present remarkable development of these
machines, he was enabled to employ the first one in the
brigade with much advantage.</p>

<p>We may quote here from a brief but excellent memoir of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Mr. Braidwood, which appeared in the annual report of the
Institution of Civil Engineers for 1861:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As early as 1841, the Government began to profit by
his experience, the Lords of the Admiralty having in that
year consulted him on the subject of floating fire-engines
for the various dockyards. These were eventually constructed
from his designs and under his superintendence.
In the following year he inspected all the dockyards, and
reported fully on each, with regard to both floating and land
fire-engines, the supply of water, the alterations of buildings
to prevent spread of fire, and the proper care required
in dangerous trades. From this time, although not holding
any appointment, he acted as Government consulting engineer
on all questions relating to fire prevention and extinction,
and he advised from time to time the precautions to
be taken for the protection of the royal palaces and various
other public buildings. This position enabled him, not without
a great deal of opposition, to induce the Government to
adopt in all its departments a uniform size of hose-coupling.
This is the one which he introduced in Edinburgh, and
known as the London Fire Brigade coupling, is now in
almost universal use; its application has been found comparatively
of as much utility for fire-brigade purposes, as
the adoption of the Whitworth gauges of screw-bolts for
mechanical engineering.</p>

<p>"Although so fully occupied, he never refused advice on
professional matters to all who sought it. The various dock
companies, public institutions, country fire brigades,
private firms, &amp;c., benefited largely by his experience. The
numerous inquiries from foreign countries and the colonies
with regard to the best means of extinguishing fires, also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
made great inroads on his time. In 1833 he became an
Associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers, to which, in
1844, he contributed a valuable paper 'On the means of
rendering large supplies of Water available in case of Fire,
&amp;c.,' for which he was awarded a Telford Medal; and in
1849 a second paper 'On Fire-Proof Buildings.' In 1856,
a paper on 'Fires: the best means of preventing and
arresting them; with a few words on Fire-Proof Structures,'
was read by him before the Society of Arts.</p>

<p>"He took great interest in the passing of Acts of Parliament
for regulating buildings in the metropolis, was consulted
by the framers of these Acts, and used his utmost
influence to prevent the endangering a whole neighbourhood
by the erection of monster warehouses for private profit.
He strongly contended for the principle of dividing buildings
by party-walls carried through the roof, and restricting
these divisions to a moderate cubic content. Writing to
Lord Seymour, Commissioner of Woods and Forests, on the
28th June, 1851, he said 'that no preparations for contending
with such fires will give anything like the security that
judicious arrangements in the size and construction of
buildings will do.' The wise provisions introduced through
his instrumentality into these Acts of Parliament were
continually being evaded, and clusters of warehouses quickly
rose which he saw would, if on fire, defy all his means of
extinction. In a letter to Sir W. Molesworth, First Commissioner
of Public Works, dated 10th February, 1854, on
the subject of a proposed warehouse in Tooley-street, he
wrote 'The whole building, if once fairly on fire in one
floor, will become such a mass of fire that there is now no
power in London capable of extinguishing it, or even of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
restraining its ravages on every side, and on three sides it
will be surrounded by property of immense value.' How
literally this was realized, and at what cost, was shown by
the great warehouse fire in Tooley-street, on the 22nd June,
1861, at which Mr. Braidwood lost his life."</p></div>

<p>The great fire at Cotton's Wharf; Tooley-street, broke
out on Saturday, June 22nd, 1861, and continued to burn
for more than a fortnight, consuming Scovell's, and other
large warehouses, and, in all, upwards of two millions'
worth of property. The fire is believed to have originated
in the spontaneous combustion of hemp, of which upwards
of 1000 tons were consumed, together with 3000 tons
of sugar, 500 tons of saltpetre, nearly 5000 tons of rice,
18,000 bales of cotton, 10,000 casks of tallow, 1100
tons of jute, and an immense quantity of tea, spices, &amp;c.,
besides many other descriptions of goods. Although discovered
in broad daylight, and before the flames had
made any considerable headway, the want of a ready
supply of water, and the fact that the iron doors in the
division walls between the several warehouses had been
left open, taken in connexion with the extremely combustible
nature of the materials, soon rendered hopeless
all chance of saving the buildings and property. Mr.
Braidwood was upon the spot very soon after the alarm
had been given, and nearly the whole available force of the
Fire-engine Establishment was summoned at his command.
He appears to have at once foreseen that the fire would be
one of no ordinary magnitude, and that the utmost that
could be done would be to prevent its extending widely over
adjoining property. The floating fire-engines had been got
to bear upon the flames, and the men in charge of the branch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
pipes were, after two hours' work, already suffering greatly
from the intense heat, when their chief went to them to give
them a word of encouragement. Several minor explosions,
as of casks of tallow or of oil, had been heard, but as it was
understood that the saltpetre stored at the wharf was in
buildings not yet alight, no alarm was then felt as to the
walls falling in. At the moment, however, while Mr.
Braidwood was discharging this his last act of kindness to
his men, a loud report was heard, and the lofty wall behind
him toppled and fell, burying him in the ruins. Those of his
men who were near him had barely time to escape, and one
person at his side, not a fireman, was overwhelmed with him.
From the moment when the wall was seen to fall, it was
known that whoever was beneath it had been instantly
crushed to death. It is needless, and it would, indeed, be
out of place, to describe here the further progress of the fire,
which had then but fairly begun, and which was still burning
more than a fortnight afterwards.</p>

<p>Great as was the general consternation at so terrible a conflagration,
it is doubtful if the public were not still more
impressed by the dreadful death of Mr. Braidwood, and by a
feeling that his loss was a public misfortune. Her Majesty
the Queen, with that ready sympathy which she has ever
shown for crushed or suffering heroism, commanded the Earl
of Stamford to inquire on the spot, on Monday, whether the
body had yet been recovered by the firemen, and Her
Majesty's sympathies were also conveyed to Mrs. Braidwood.
It was not, however, until the following morning, that after
almost constant exertions, under the greatest difficulties, the
crushed remains were rescued. An inquest was necessary,
not merely to ascertain what was already well known, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
death had been instantly caused by accident, but to know
whether culpable carelessness of any kind had indirectly led
to the sorrowful event. None, however, appeared. The
remains of the fallen chief were afterwards borne to his late
residence in Watling-street. The members of the committee
of the London Fire-engine Establishment, formed of representatives
from all of the twenty-five insurance companies of
London, had already met to express, by a formal resolution,
their sincere condolence with Mrs. Braidwood and her family.
It was known that the funeral would take place on Saturday,
June 29th, and it was widely felt that a general
expression of sorrow and respect should be made, in view of
the common loss of so valued a public servant, as well as for
the noble qualities for which he had been so long and so well
known. On the occasion of the funeral this was shown not
more by the great length and marked character of the
<i>cort&eacute;ge</i> itself than by the general suspension of business in
the leading thoroughfares of the city through which it
passed, and by the hushed demeanour of the countless multitude
who pressed closely upon the procession throughout
its entire course. Among the thousands who sadly led
the way to the grave were the London Rifle Brigade, about
700 strong (and of which Mr. Braidwood's three sons
were members), the Seventh Tower-Hamlets, and other
rifle corps, upwards of 1000 constables of the metropolitan
police force, besides nearly 400 members of the
city police, the superintendents and men of the various
water companies, the secretary and conductors and the
band of the Royal Society for the Protection of Life from
Fire, a large number of private and local fire-brigades,
and the members of the London Fire-engine Establishment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
The pall-bearers were six of Mr. Braidwood's engineers and
foremen, some of whom were at his side when he fell, and
who had barely escaped with their own lives. Following the
chief mourners were the Duke of Sutherland, the Earl of
Caithness, the Rev. Dr. Cumming, and a large number of
relatives and friends of the deceased, and the committee of
the London Fire-engine establishment. The procession was
nearly one mile and a-half in length, and was about three
hours in its progress from Watling-street to Abney Park
Cemetery, where the solemn service of the dead was conducted
by the Rev. Dr. Cumming, of whose congregation the
deceased had long been a member. With the exception of
the great bell of St. Paul's, which tolls only on the occasion
of the death of a member of the royal family or of a lord-mayor
in office, the bells of all the churches in the city were
booming slowly through the day, and so evident was the
general sorrow that it could be truly said that the heart of
the nation mourned.</p>

<p>On Thursday, July 4th, a public meeting was held at the
Mansion House, when resolutions were passed for the collection
of subscriptions towards a memorial to Mr. Braidwood's
long and arduous public services. This memorial, it was felt,
should take the form of a permanent provision for his family,
for the post of Fire Brigade Superintendent had never been a
lucrative one. Before, however, the collection of subscriptions
had extended beyond a few hundred pounds, it was
made known that the insurance companies had promptly
settled upon Mrs. Braidwood the full "value"&mdash;speaking in
an insurable sense&mdash;of her husband's life. Mr. Braidwood
had for many years supported two maiden sisters, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
public subscription was applied, therefore, to the purchase of
small annuities for each of them.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the London Fire-engine
Establishment was from the first controlled only by the
insurance companies, upon whom of course, fell the whole
cost of its maintenance. Their interest in the suppression
of fires, although direct and unmistakeable, was not the same
as that of the public. Thus, it would be to the public
advantage that no fires should happen, whereas such a result
would be fatal to the insurance companies, since no one in
that case would insure. Although the protection of the
Establishment was in practice extended alike to both
insured and uninsured property, the real object for which it
was formed and maintained was undoubtedly that of protecting
insured property only. It was the interest of the
companies to incur as little expense as would, on the whole,
fairly effect this purpose, and it was not their interest to
effectually protect the whole of the metropolis from fire. Thus
it was that, with all the excellence of the organization and
discipline of the Fire-engine Establishment, it was greatly
inferior in extent to what was requisite for the proper
security of the first city in the world. Mr. Braidwood had long
felt this truth, but, acting for a private association, he could
only go to the extent of the limited resources at his disposal.
It was, more than anything else, the great fire at Cotton's
Wharf that first directed public attention to the necessary
insufficiency of any private establishment for the general
suppression of fires, and that has led to the legislation under
which the Fire-engine Establishment was, on the 1st of
January last, taken over and extended by the Metropolitan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Board of Works. London will now, it is hoped, be better
protected from fire, because of the increased extent of the
means of protection; but it can hardly be expected that the
discipline of the brigade will be improved.</p>

<p>Apart from the public value of Mr. Braidwood's career
in increasing the common security against a common foe,
there was much in his personal, intellectual, and moral qualities
worthy of admiration. He was a man of strong and
commanding frame, of inexhaustible energy, and of enduring
vitality. The constitutions of but few men could have withstood
such long continued wear and tear as fell to his. He
braved all weathers, all extremes of heat and cold, could
sleep or wake at will, and could work on long after others
would have given way. He was always at his post, and in
no moment of difficulty or danger did his cool judgment or
his steady courage forsake him. It was this, together with
his considerate bearing, and on occasions of special trial his
almost womanly kindness to his men, that inspired them with
unlimited confidence in him and in his plans. Beyond this,
he was a man of superior mind, with strong comprehensive
and generalising faculties. His various published papers,
and a correspondence of which but few could know the extent
and importance, as well as his ready, clear, and exact
manner in stating his views before committees and before
those in authority, who so often consulted him, all attest an
order of mind which, in a different sphere, would alone have
won distinction for its possessor. His profession was one in
which it happens that almost every person thinks himself
competent to give advice; yet, without any assumption of
authority, Mr. Braidwood could make it felt wherever he
pleased that he was a master in the art of extinguishing fire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
But he was not on this account the less ready to listen to
suggestions, and there are numbers who can bear testimony
to the patient, honest, and appreciative manner in which
he considered the many and diverse propositions submitted
to him as the head of the Fire Brigade of the first city
in the world. The soundness of his views and opinions
is sufficiently attested by the success of his practice&mdash;a
success which, but for the Government tax upon fire
policies, would have long since made fire insurance in
London almost the cheapest of all the forms of protection
of property from danger. The London Brigade was
insignificant in numbers and tame in display when compared
with the eight hundred <i>sapeurs pompiers</i> of Paris,
with their parade and all their accessories of effect&mdash;insignificant
and tame, too, after the glittering apparatus, imposing
paraphernalia, and deafening clatter of the "Fire
Department" of New York; but Mr. Braidwood's chosen
men knew how to do their duty, and considering the
differences in the mode of building and of heating, and in
the extent of lighting in the three great metropoli just
named, it is an easy matter, on reference to statistics, to
prove that none others have done better.</p>

<p>Above all, Mr. Braidwood was a gentleman of deep
Christian feeling; and those who knew him best had never
doubted that, had it been his lot to linger long in pain,
knowing the end that was to come, his calm but unwavering
faith in a better future would have sustained him through
all. Brought up from childhood in the faith of the Scotch
church, he was a regular attendant upon the ministrations of
the Rev. Dr. Cumming. In his own quiet way he did much
good in the poorer districts of London, and he took a special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
interest in the ragged schools of the metropolis. What he
was in his own home may be best inferred from the crushing
force with which his dreadful yet noble fate fell upon those
who were dearest to him. His family had already too much
reason to know the dangers which had always attended his
career. A step-son had fallen, five years before, in nearly the
same manner, and now lies buried in the same grave. Eleven
members, in all, of the brigade, had perished in the discharge
of their duty during the time Mr. Braidwood had commanded
it: a fact which, taken with daily experience,
pointed to other victims to follow. Such consolation, then,
as a stricken widow and a mourning family could have,
next to an abiding faith in the goodness of God, was in the
recollection of the virtues and noble qualities of the husband
and father, and in the spontaneous sorrow with which a
great people testified their sense of his worth and of their
common loss.</p>

<p>To show the universal as well as national esteem in which
Mr. Braidwood was held, two extracts are here given from
the numerous letters of condolence addressed to his bereaved
family, from all parts of the world. Mr. G. H. Allen,
Secretary to the Boston (America) Fire Department, writes:
"It gives me pleasure to unite with the Board in testimony
to the extreme kindness of Mr. Braidwood in the conduct of
our correspondence, whereby we have been greatly benefited
and received extensive information. Allow me also to extend
our sympathy to those who have lost one who will ever be
remembered as standing at the head of the most valued arm
of the Government, and one that you can hardly expect to
be replaced, except by years of experience and great natural
ability." Mr. T. J. Bown, Superintendent of the Sydney<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
(Australia) Fire Brigade, in a letter dated 22nd August
1861, says, "On receipt of the sad news, our large fire-bell
was tolled, the British ensign hoisted half-mast high, and
crape attached to the firemen's uniform, as a token of respect
for one of the noblest and most self-denying men that ever
lived, who spent and lost his life in the service of his fellow-creatures."</p>

<h2><a name="FIRE_PREVENTION" id="FIRE_PREVENTION"></a>FIRE PREVENTION</h2>

<h4>INCLUDING</h4>

<h2>FIRE-PROOF STRUCTURES.</h2>


<p>To prevent fires it is necessary to consider what are the
principal causes of such calamities. These may be classed
under several heads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Inattention in the use of fires and lights.</p>

<p>2. Improper construction of buildings, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. Furnaces or close fires for heating buildings, or for mechanical
purposes.</p>

<p>4. Spontaneous ignition.</p>

<p>5. Incendiarism.</p></div>

<p>As almost all fires arise from inattention in one shape or
another, it is of the utmost importance that every master of
a house or other establishment should persevere in rigidly
enjoining and enforcing on those under him, the necessity of
observing the utmost possible care in preventing such calamities,
which, in nineteen cases out of twenty, are the result
of remissness or inattention. Indeed, if any one will for a
moment consider the fearful risk of life and property, which
is often incurred from a very slight inattention, the necessity
of vigilance and care will at once be apparent. Immense
hazard is frequently incurred for the most trifling indulgences,
and much property is annually destroyed, and valuable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
lives often lost, because a few thoughtless individuals cannot
deny themselves the gratification of reading in bed with a
candle beside them.</p>

<p>Some years ago, upwards of 100,000<i>l.</i> were lost, through
the partner of a large establishment lighting gas with a piece
of paper, which he threw away, and thus set fire to the premises,
although it was a strict rule in the place that gas
should only be lighted with tapers, which were provided for
that purpose. In one department of a great public institution,
it was, and is still, a rule that only covered lights
should be carried about, and for that purpose four lanterns
were provided; yet, on inquiry some time back, it was found
that only one was entire, the other three being broken&mdash;one
having lost two sides and the top; still they were all used as
covered lights.</p>

<p>The opportunities for inattention to fires and lights are
so various, that it is impossible to notice the whole.</p>

<p>One of the prevailing causes of fire is to be traced to persons
locking their doors, and leaving their houses to the care
of children. I believe one-half of the children whose deaths
are occasioned by accident suffer from this cause alone: indeed,
almost every week the newspapers contain some melancholy
confirmation of what I have here stated. Intoxication
is also a disgraceful and frequent cause of fire. The number
of persons burned to death in this way is really incredible.
It is true that it does not always happen that a fire takes
place in the house, in either of the above cases, although the
unfortunate beings whose clothes take fire, rarely escape with
their lives; but the danger to the neighbourhood is at all
times considerable, if persons in a state of inebriety are left
in a house alone. When there is reason to apprehend that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
any member of a family will come home at night in that
state, some one should always be appointed to receive him,
and on no account to leave him till he is put to bed, and the
light extinguished.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that people must be actually drunk
before danger is to be apprehended from them. Indeed, a
very slight degree of inebriety is dangerous, as it always tends
to blunt the perception, and to make a person careless and
indifferent. I may also add, that no inconsiderable number
of fires are occasioned by the thoughtless practice of throwing
spirits into the fire. The dresses of females taking fire adds
very much to the list of lives lost by fire, if it does not exceed
all the other causes put together.</p>

<p>Another very general cause of fire is that of approaching
with lighted candles too near bed or window curtains; these,
being generally quite dry, are, from the way in which they
are hung, easily set on fire, and, as the flames ascend rapidly,
when once touched, they are in a blaze in a moment.</p>

<p>It is really astonishing to find that, with daily examples
before their eyes, people should persist (whether insured or
not seems to make little difference) in practices which, there
is a hundred chances to one, may involve both themselves and
the neighbourhood in one common ruin. Of this sort are
the practices of looking under a bed with a lighted candle,
and placing a screen full of clothes too near the fire.</p>

<p>Houses not unfrequently take fire from cinders falling
between the joints of the outer and inner hearths. When
smoke is observed to arise from the floor, the cause should be
immediately ascertained, and the inmates ought on no
account to retire to rest while there is the slightest smell of
fire, or any grounds to suspect danger from that cause.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Occasional fires are caused by a very absurd method of
extinguishing at night the fires kept in grates during the
day. Instead of arranging the embers in the grate in such a
way as to prevent their falling off, and thus allowing the fire
to die out in its proper place, they are frequently taken off
and laid on the hearth, where, should there be wood-work
underneath, it becomes scorched, and the slightest spark
falling through a joint in the stones sets it on fire.</p>

<p>A very frequent cause of fire in shops and warehouses
arises from the carelessness of the person intrusted to lock
them up. It is no uncommon practice with those to whom
this duty is intrusted, to light themselves out, or to search for
any little article which may have been mislaid, with a lighted
paper, and then to throw it carelessly on the floor, imagining
they have taken every necessary precaution, merely by setting
their foot upon it, forgetting that the current of air occasioned
by shutting the door frequently rekindles it, and produces
the most serious consequences.</p>

<p>In warehouses and manufactories, fires are not unfrequently
caused by the workmen being occasionally kept late
at work. By the time their task is finished, the men are so
tired and sleepy, that the extinguishing of fires and lights is
done in a very careless manner. I recollect an instance of
this sort, in which the flames were issuing from three upper
windows, and observed by the neighbours, while the workmen
engaged at their employment in the lower floors knew
nothing of the destruction that was going on above.</p>

<p>A very serious annual loss is also caused by want of
due care in handing up or removing the goods in linen-drapers'
shop windows when the gas is burning. Flues
taking fire often result in mischief and it is believed that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
many serious fires have arisen from this cause, which can
hardly be called accidental, as, if flues are properly constructed,
kept moderately clean, and fairly used, they cannot
take fire.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will be seen that care and
attention may do a very great deal towards the prevention
of fire, and consequent loss of life. It is very easy to make
good rules, and keep them for a time, after having been
alarmed by some serious loss of property or life, but the
difficulty is to maintain constant attention to the subject.
The most evident plan for effecting this seems to be, for the
masters thoroughly to examine and consider the subject at
certain stated periods, not too far apart, and to constantly
warn their domestics, workmen, or others, of the danger of
the improper use of fires and lights.</p>

<p>One of the greatest preventives of carelessness in the
use of fires and lights would be a legal inquiry in every
case, as it would not only show the faults that had been
committed, and thus warn others, but the idea of being exposed
in the newspapers would be another motive for
increased care. This plan has been adopted in New York,
and the reports of the proceedings of Mr. Baker, the "Fire
Marshal," show that the inquiries there made have led to
most useful results. Mr. Payne, the coroner, held inquests
on fires in the City of London some years ago, but the
authorities would not allow his expenses, and therefore they
were given up, although believed to be highly advantageous
in explaining accidental and others causes of fire.</p>

<p><i>The improper construction of buildings</i> more generally
assists the spread than is the original cause of fires, although
laying hearths on timber, and placing timber too near flues,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
are constant causes of fire, and it is believed that many
melancholy occurrences have arisen from these and similar
sources.</p>

<p>One cause of danger from chimneys arises from the communication
which they often have with each other in one
gable. The divisions or partitions, being very often found
in an imperfect state, the fire communicates to the adjoining
chimney, and in this way sometimes wraps a whole tenement
in flames. I know a division of a principal street in Edinburgh,
in which there is scarcely a single chimney-head that
is not more or less in this condition; and I have no doubt
that this is not an uncommon case. There is also great
danger from the ends of joists, safe-lintels, or other pieces of
timber, being allowed to protrude into chimneys. In one
instance which came under my notice, a flue passing under
the recess of a window had on the upper side no other
covering than the wood of the floor; of course, when the
chimney took fire the floor was immediately in a blaze: but
there are many instances of such carelessness. It is a
common practice amongst carpenters to drive small pieces of
wood into walls for the purpose of fixing their work, not
paying the least attention as to whether the points run into
the flues or not.</p>

<p>In the repairs and alterations of old buildings, house-carpenters
are, if possible, even more careless in this particular,
than in the construction of new.</p>

<p>I know of two different buildings which underwent some
alterations. In both of these, safe-lintels had been run into
flues, and both of them, after the alterations, took fire; the
one in consequence of a foul chimney, which set fire to the
lintel; and although the other did not take fire from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
same cause, the lintel was nevertheless very much scorched,
and obliged to be removed.</p>

<p>Great carelessness is frequently exhibited by builders,
when erecting at one time two or three houses connected by
mutual gables, by not carrying up the gables, or party-walls,
so as to divide the roofs. I have seen more than one instance
where the adjoining house would have been quite safe, but
for this culpable neglect. It is no uncommon thing, too, to
find houses divided only by lath and standard partitions,
without a single brick in them. When a fire occurs in
houses divided in this manner, the vacuities in the middle
of the partitions act like so many funnels to conduct the
flame, thereby greatly adding to the danger from the fire,
and infinitely increasing the difficulty of extinguishing it.</p>

<p>In London the Building Act forbids all such proceedings,
but the District Surveyors do not seem to have sufficient
power, or be able to pay sufficient attention to such matters,
as they are constantly met with at fires. A very flagrant
case of laying a hearth on timber was lately exposed by a
fire in the City. Due notice was given of the circumstance,
but no farther attention was paid to the matter than to
make the proprietor construct the floor properly, although
the Act gave power to fine for such neglect. The omission
is to be regretted, as there could not have been a better case
for warning others; it occurred in a very large establishment,
and the work was done by one of the first builders in
the City. Had this fire taken place in the night and
gained some head, it would have been very difficult to have
ascertained the cause. As the premises were situated, a
serious loss of life might have occurred, the apartment in
which the fire originated being the only means of retreat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
which ten or twelve female servants had from their bedrooms.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Building Acts, up to about the year
1825, by insisting upon party-walls and other precautions,
were invaluable for the prevention of the spread of fires. By
them no warehouse was permitted to exceed a certain area.
From the year 1842, the area has been exchanged for a
specified number of cubic feet. But since 1825, a class of
buildings has arisen of which there are now considerable
numbers in the City, called Manchester or piece goods warehouses,
which somehow have been exempted from the law
restricting the extent of warehouses, on the plea that
they are <i>not</i> warehouses, because "bulk is broken" in
them, although it is thoroughly understood that the legislature
intended by the Act to restrict the amassing such
a quantity of goods under one roof as would be dangerous
to the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Manchester and piece goods warehouses have for some
time past been built in London of unlimited size, sometimes
equal to twenty average houses. This is pretty nearly the
same as if that number of houses were built without party-walls,
only that it is much worse, for the whole mass generally
communicates by well holes and open staircases, and
thus takes fire with great rapidity, and, from the quantity of
fresh air within the building, the fire makes much greater
progress before it is discovered. By this means the risk of
fire in the City has been greatly increased, not only to such
warehouses themselves, but to the surrounding neighbourhood,
for it is impossible to say how far fires of such magnitude
may extend their ravages under untoward circumstances,
there being at present no preventive power in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
London capable of controlling them. To provide such a
power would be a very costly business.</p>

<p>Such buildings are also against the generally received rule,
that a man may burn himself and his own property, but he
shall not unduly risk the lives and property of his
neighbours.</p>

<p>The new Building Act is likely to repress, to a certain
extent, this great evil, unless its meaning be subverted by
some such subterfuge as destroyed the efficiency of the last
one. But what is to be done with those which are already
built? It may seem tedious to dwell so much on this subject,
but it appears to be a risk which is not generally much
thought of, though it is of the most vital importance to the
safety of London. It is very desirable that the metropolis
should take warning by the experience of Liverpool,
without going through the fiery ordeal which the latter city
did.</p>

<p>From 1838 to 1843, 776,762<i>l.</i> were lost in Liverpool by
fire, almost entirely in the warehouse risks. The consequence
was, that the mercantile rates of insurance gradually rose
from about 8<i>s.</i> per cent. to 30<i>s.</i>, 40<i>s.</i>, and, it is said, in some
cases, to 45<i>s.</i> per cent. Such premiums could not be paid
on wholesale transactions, therefore the Liverpool people
themselves obtained an Act of Parliament, 6 and 7 Vic.,
cap. 109, by which the size and height of warehouses were
restricted, party walls were made imperative, and warehouses
were not allowed to be erected within thirty-six feet of any
other warehouse, unless the whole of the doors and window-shutters
were made of <i>wrought iron</i>, with many similar
restrictions. This Act applied to warehouses already built as
well as to those to be built, and any tenant was at liberty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
after notice to his landlord, to alter his warehouse according
to the Act, and to stop his rent till the expense was paid.
Another Act, 6 and 7 Vic., cap. 75, was also obtained, for
bringing water into Liverpool for the purpose of extinguishing
fires and watering the streets <i>only</i>. It is supposed that
the works directed, or permitted, by these two Acts, cost
the people of Liverpool from 200,000<i>l.</i> to 300,000<i>l.</i> Shortly
after these alterations had been made, the mercantile premiums
again fell to about 8<i>s.</i> per cent.</p>

<p>There is another very common cause of fire, which seems
to come under the head of construction&mdash;viz., covering up
a fireplace when not in use with wood or paper and canvas,
&amp;c. The soot falls into the fireplace, either from the flue
itself, or from an adjoining one which communicates with it.
A neighbouring chimney takes fire; a spark falls down the
blocked-up flue, sets fire to the soot in the fireplace, which
smoulders till the covering is burned through, and thus sets
fire to the premises.</p>

<p>In theatres, that part of the house which includes the
stage and scenery should be carefully divided from that
where the spectators assemble by a solid wall carried up
to, and through the roof. The opening in this wall for the
stage should be arched over, and the other communications
secured with iron doors, which would be kept shut while the
audience was in the house. By this plan, there would be
abundance of time for the spectators to retire, before
fire could reach that part of the theatre which they
occupy.</p>

<p><i>The danger from furnaces</i> or close fires, whether for
heating, cooking, or manufacturing purposes, is very great,
and no flue should be permitted to be so used, unless it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
prepared for the purpose. The reason is, that in a close fire
the whole of the draught must pass through the fire. It
thus becomes so heated that, unless the flue is properly
built, it is dangerous throughout its whole course. In one
instance of a heating furnace, the heat in the flue was found
to be 300&deg;, at a distance of from forty to fifty feet from the
fire. In open fireplaces, the quantity of cold air carried up
with the draught keeps the flue at a moderate heat, from the
fire upwards, and, unless the flue is allowed to become foul,
and take fire, this is the safest possible mode of heating.</p>

<p>Heating by hot air, steam, and hot water are objectionable.
First, because there must be a furnace and furnace
flue, and the flue used is generally that built for an open fire
only; and second, the pipes are carried in every direction, to
be as much out of sight as possible. By this means they are
constantly liable to produce spontaneous ignition, for there
appears to be some chemical action between heated iron and
timber, by which fire is generated at a much lower temperature
than is necessary to ignite timber under ordinary circumstances.
No satisfactory explanation of this fact has yet
been given, but there is abundant proof that such is the
case. In heating by hot-water pipes, those hermetically
sealed are by far the most dangerous, as the strength of the
pipes to resist the pressure is the only limit of the heat to
which the water, and of course the pipes, may be raised. In
some cases a plug of metal which fuses at 400&deg; is put into
the pipes, but the heat to which the plug is exposed will
depend very much on where it is placed, as, however great
may be the heat of the exit pipe, the return pipe is comparatively
cool. But even where the pipes are left open, the
heat of the water at the furnace is not necessarily 212&deg;. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
is almost needless to say that 212&deg; is the heat of boiling
water under the pressure of one atmosphere only; but if the
pipes are carried sixty or seventy feet high, the water in the
furnace must be under the pressure of nearer three atmospheres
than one, and therefore the heat will be proportionately
increased. Fires from pipes for heating by hot
water have been known to take place within twenty-four
hours after first heating, and some after ten years of apparent
safety.</p>

<p>The New Metropolitan Building Act prescribes rules for
the placing steam, hot-air, and hot-water pipes at a certain
distance from timber; but as it must be extremely difficult
for the District Surveyors to watch such minute proceedings,
it becomes every one who is anxious for safety to see that
the District Surveyors have due notice of any operation of
this kind.</p>

<p>Another cause of fire which may come under this head is
the use of pipes for conveying away the products of combustion.
Every one is acquainted with the danger of stove
pipes, but all are not perhaps aware that pipes for conveying
away the heat and effluvia from gas-burners are also very
dangerous when placed near timber. It is not an uncommon
practice to convey such pipes between the ceiling and the
flooring of the floor above. This is highly dangerous. Gas-burners
are also dangerous when placed near a ceiling. A
remarkable instance of this took place lately, where a gas-burner
set fire to a ceiling 28-1/2 inches from it.</p>

<p>Another evil of furnaces is, that the original fireplace is
sometimes not large enough to contain the apparatus, and
the party wall is cut into. Perhaps it may be necessary to
notice at this point the use of gas, as it is becoming so very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
general. Gas, if carefully laid on, and properly used, is
safer than any other light, so far as actually setting fire to
anything goes, but the greater heat given out so dries up
any combustibles within its reach, that it prepares them for
burning, and when a fire does take place, the destruction is
much more rapid than in a building lighted by other means.
Gas-stoves, also, from the great heat given out, sometimes
cause serious accidents; in one instance, a gas-stove set fire
to a beam through a two-and-half inch York landing, well
bedded in mortar, although the lights were five or six inches
above the stone. This is mentioned to show that gas-stoves
require quite as much care as common fires.</p>

<p><i>Spontaneous ignition</i> is believed to be a very fruitful
cause of fires; but, unless the fire is discovered almost at the
commencement, it is difficult to ascertain positively that
this has been the cause. Spontaneous ignition is generally
accelerated by natural or artificial heat. For instance,
where substances liable to spontaneous ignition are exposed
to the heat of the sun, to furnace flues, heated pipes, or are
placed over apartments lighted by gas, the process of ignition
proceeds much more rapidly than when in a cooler atmosphere.
Sawdust in contact with vegetable oil is very likely
to take fire. Cotton, cotton waste, hemp, and most other
vegetable substances are alike dangerous. In one case oil
and sawdust took fire within sixteen hours; in others, the
same materials have lain for years, until some external heat
has been applied to them. The greater number of the
serious fires which have taken place in railroad stations in
and near London have commenced in the paint stores. In
a very large fire in an oil warehouse, a quantity of oil was
spilt the day before and wiped up, the wipings being thrown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
aside. This was believed to have been the cause of the fire,
but direct proof could not be obtained. Dust-bins also very
often cause serious accidents. In one instance, 30,000<i>l.</i> to
40,000<i>l.</i> were lost, apparently from hot ashes being thrown
into a dust-bin.</p>

<p>These accidents may in a great measure be avoided by
constant care and attention to cleanliness, and where paints
and oils are necessary, by keeping them in some place outside
the principal buildings. Dust-bins should, as much as possible,
be placed in the open air, and where that cannot be
done, they should be emptied once a day. No collection of
rubbish or lumber of any sort should be allowed to be made
in any building of value.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyatt Papworth, architect, has published some very
interesting notes on spontaneous ignition, giving several well-authenticated
instances.</p>

<p><i>Incendiarism</i> may be divided into three sorts&mdash;malicious,
fraudulent, and monomaniac. Of the former there has been
very little in London for many years. The second, however,
is rather prevalent. The insurance offices, which are the
victims, protect themselves as well as they can, but an
inquest on each fire is the true mode of lessening the evil.
This is much more the interest of the public than at first
seems to be the case. In several instances where the criminals
were brought to punishment by Mr. Payne's inquests, people
were asleep in the upper parts of the houses set fire to, and
in one case there were as many as twelve or fifteen persons.
This, however, is seldom stated in the indictment, as, if it is,
the punishment is still death by the law, and it is supposed
that a conviction is more easily obtained, by the capital
charge being waived. Monomania is a rare cause of incendiarism,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
but still several well-certified cases have occurred in
which no possible motive could be given. In one instance a
youth of fifteen set fire to his father's premises seven times
within a few hours. In another, a young female on a visit
set fire to her friend's furniture, &amp;c., ten or eleven times in
the course of one or two days. In neither case could anything
like disagreement or harshness be elicited, but the
reverse. In other instances, it has been strongly suspected
that this disease was the cause of repeated fires, but there
was no positive proof. In all these cases, known or suspected,
the parties were generally from fourteen to twenty
years of age.</p>


<h3>FIRE-PROOF STRUCTURES.</h3>

<p>What is "Fire-proof Construction?" is a question which
has given rise to a great deal of discussion, simply, as it
appears to me, because the size of the buildings, and the
quantity and description of the contents, have not always
been taken into account. That which may be perfectly fireproof
in a dwelling house, may be the weakest in a
large warehouse. Suppose an average-sized dwelling-house
20 &times; 40 &times; 50 = 40,000 cubic feet, built with brick partitions,
stone or slate stairs, wrought-iron joists filled in with concrete,
and the whole well plastered. Such a house will be
practically fire-proof, because there is no probability that the
furniture and flooring in any one room, would make fire
enough to communicate to another. But suppose a warehouse
equal to twenty such houses, with floors completely
open, supported by cast-iron pillars, and each floor communicating
with the others by open staircases and wells; suppose,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
further, that it is half filled with combustible goods, and
perhaps the walls and ceilings lined with timber. Now, if a
fire takes place below, the moment it bursts through the
upper windows or skylights, the whole place becomes an
immense blast furnace; the iron is melted, and in a comparatively
short time the building is in ruins, and, it may be,
the half of the neighbourhood destroyed. The real fire-proof
construction for such buildings is groined brick arches, supported
on brick pillars only. This mode of building, however,
involves so much expense, and occupies so much space,
that it cannot be used with advantage. The next best plan
is to build the warehouses in compartments of moderate size,
divided by party-walls and double wrought-iron doors, so
that if one of these compartments takes fire, there may be a
reasonable prospect of confining the fire to that compartment
only. Again, cast iron gives way from so many different
causes, that it is impossible to calculate when it will give
way. The castings may have flaws in them; or they may be
too weak for the weight they have to support, being sometimes
within 10 per cent., or less, of the breaking weight.
The expansion of the girders may thrust out the side walls.
For instance, in a warehouse 120 feet &times; 75 feet &times; 80 feet,
there are three continuous rows of girders on each floor, with
butt joints; the expansion in this case may be twelve inches.
The tie rods to take the strain of the flat arches must expand
and become useless, and the whole of the lateral strain be
thrown on the girders and side walls, perhaps weak enough
already. Again, throwing cold water on the heated iron may
cause an immediate fracture. For these and similar reasons,
the firemen are not permitted to go into warehouses supported
by iron, <i>when once fairly on fire</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Cast and wrought-iron have been frequently fused at fires
in large buildings such as warehouses, sugar houses, &amp;c., but
according to Mr. Fairbairn's experiments on cast iron in a
heated state, it is not necessary that the fusing point should
be attained to cause it to give way.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> He also states, that
the loss of strength in cold-blast cast iron, in a variation of
temperature from 26&deg; to 190&deg; = 164&deg; Fahr., is 10 per cent.,
and in hot-blast at a variation of from 21&deg; to 190&deg; = 169&deg;
Fahr., is 15 per cent.; now if the loss of strength advances
in anything like this ratio, the iron will be totally useless as
a support, long before the fusing point is attained.</p>

<p>Much confidence has been placed in wrought-iron tie or
tension rods, to take the lateral strain of the arches, and also
in trusses to support the beams; but it must be evident
that the expansion of the iron from the heat, would render
them useless, and under a high temperature, it would be so
great as to unsettle the brickwork, and accelerate its fall, on
any part of the iron-work giving way: again, the application
of cold water to the heated iron, in an endeavour to
extinguish the fire, is almost certain to cause one or more
fractures. The brick-arching is also very liable to fall, especially
if only four and a half inches thick, independently of
the weight which may be placed upon it, for it is not uncommon
after a fire in a large building, to find the mortar
almost completely pulverized to the depth of three inches,
or four inches, from the face of the wall. When a fire
occurred under one of the arches of the Blackwall Railway,
on the 15th July, 1843, a portion of the lower ring fell
down, and also a few bricks from the next ring.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p>Another very serious objection to buildings of this description,
is that, unless scientifically constructed, they are
very unlikely to be safe, even for the common purposes intended,
independent of the risk of fire. In the Report of
Sir Henry De la B&ecirc;che and Mr. Thomas Cubitt on the fall
of the mill at Oldham, in October, 1844,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> it is stated that
the strength of the iron-beams was within ten per cent. of
the breaking weight. Now according to Mr. Fairbairn's
experiments on heated iron, already referred to, an increase
of temperature of only 170&deg; would have destroyed the whole
building. It is quite clear, therefore, that so long as mill-owners
and others continue to construct such buildings without
proper advice, they must be liable to these accidents.
In timber-floors there can be no such risk, as the strains are
all direct, and any journeyman carpenter, by following good
examples, can ascertain the size required; and even if he
makes a mistake, the evil is comparatively trivial, as the
timber will give notice before yielding, and may be propped
up for the time, until it can be properly secured. In the
case of fire-proof buildings, an ignorant person may make
many mistakes without being aware that he has done so,
and the slightest failure is probably fatal to every one within
the walls. This also increases the difficulty and danger of
extinguishing fires in a large building, as the only method of
doing so is for the firemen to enter it with their branches,
and in case of the floors falling, there is no chance of escape.
On the other hand, timber-floors have repeatedly fallen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
while the firemen were inside the building, and they have
made their escape uninjured.</p>

<p>In a pamphlet published by Mr. S. Holme, of Liverpool,
in 1844,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> and which contains a report from Mr. Fairbairn on
fire-proof buildings, it is stated, that many people, especially
in the manufacturing districts, are their own architects; that
the warehouses in Liverpool may be loaded to one ton per
yard of flooring; and that unless great care and knowledge
are used in the construction of fire-proof buildings, they are
of all others the most dangerous.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>The following are the principles on which Mr. Fairbairn
proposes to build fire-proof warehouses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The whole of the building to be composed of non-combustible
materials, such as iron, stone, or bricks.</p>

<p>In order to prevent fire, whether arising from accident or
spontaneous combustion, every opening, or crevice, communicating
with the external atmosphere to be closed.</p>

<p>An isolated staircase, of stone, or iron, well protected on
every side by brick, or stone walls, to be attached to
every story, and be furnished with a line of water-pipes,
communicating with the mains in the street, and
ascending to the top of the building.</p>

<p>In a range of stores, the different warehouses to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
divided by strong partition-walls, in no case less than
eighteen inches thick, and no more openings to be made
than are absolutely necessary for the admission of goods
and light.</p>

<p>That the iron columns, beams, and brick arches be of
strength sufficient, not only to support a continuous
dead pressure, but to resist the force of impact to which
they are subject by the falling of heavy goods upon the
floors.</p>

<p>That in order to prevent accident from the columns being
melted by intense heat in the event of fire in any of
the rooms, a current of cold air should be introduced
into the hollow of the columns, from an arched tunnel
under the floors.</p></div>

<p>There is no doubt that if the second principle could be
carried out, namely, the total exclusion of air, the fire would
go out of itself; but it seems, to say the least of it, very
doubtful indeed if this can be accomplished, and if it could,
the carelessness of a porter leaving open one of the doors or
windows, would make the whole useless. The fifth principle
shows that Mr. Fairbairn has omitted to allow for the loss of
strength the iron may sustain from the increase of temperature.
The last principle would not be likely to answer its
purpose, even if it was possible to keep these tunnels and
hollow columns clear for a number of years, which is scarcely
to be expected. A piece of cast-iron pipe, one-and-a-half
inch in diameter, was heated for four minutes in a common
forge, both ends being carefully kept open to the atmosphere,
when, on one end being fixed in a vice, and the other pulled
aside by the hand, it gave way.</p>

<p>One of the principal objections to the kind of fire-proof<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
buildings above described, is, that absolute perfection in their
construction is indispensable to their safety; whereas buildings
of a more common description are comparatively safe,
although there may be some errors or omissions in their
construction. Indeed, Mr. Fairbairn states in the same
Report, that "it is true that negligence of construction on
the one hand, and want of care in management on the other,
might entail risk and loss to an enormous extent."</p>

<p>The following is a very clear proof of the inability of cast
iron to resist the effects of fire:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A chapel in Liverpool-road, Islington, seventy feet in
length and fifty-two feet in breadth, took fire in the cellar,
on the 2nd October, 1848, and was completely burned down.
After the fire, it was ascertained that of thirteen cast-iron
pillars used to support the galleries, only two remained perfect;
the greater part of the others were broken into small
pieces, the metal appearing to have lost all power of cohesion,
and some parts were melted. It should be observed,
that these pillars were of ample strength to support the galleries
when filled by the congregation, but when the fire
reached them, they crumbled under the weight of the timber
only, lightened as it must have been by the progress of the
fire."</p>

<p>In this case it mattered little whether the pillars stood or
fell, but it would be very different with some of the large
wholesale warehouses in the City, where numbers of young
men sleep in the upper floors; in several of those warehouses
the cast-iron pillars are much less in proportion to the
weight to be carried than those referred to, and would be
completely in the draught of a fire. If a fire should unfortunately
take place under such circumstances, the loss of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
human life might be very great, as the chance of fifty,
eighty, or one hundred people escaping in the confusion of a
sudden night alarm, by one or two ladders, to the roof,
could scarcely be calculated on, and the time such escape
must necessarily occupy, independent of all chance of accidents,
would be considerable.</p>

<p>For the reasons here stated, I submit that large buildings,
containing considerable quantities of combustible goods, with
floors of brick-arches, supported by cast-iron beams and
columns, are not, practically speaking, fire-proof; and that
the only construction which would render large buildings
fire-proof; where considerable quantities of combustible goods
are deposited, would be groined brick-arches, supported by
pillars of the same material, laid in proper cement. I am
fully convinced, from a lengthened experience, that the intensity
of a fire,&mdash;the risk of its ravages extending to adjoining
premises, and also the difficulty of extinguishing it,
depend, <i>c&aelig;teris paribus</i>, on the cubic contents of the building
which takes fire, and it appears to me that the amount
of loss would be very much reduced, if, instead of building
immense warehouses, which give the fire a fortified position,
warehouses were made of a moderate size, with access on two
sides at least, completely separated from each other by party-walls,
and protected by iron-doors and window-shutters. In
the latter case, the probability is, that not more than one
warehouse would be lost at a time, and perhaps that one
would be only partially injured.</p>

<p>It is sincerely to be hoped that the clause in the last
Metropolitan Building Act, restricting the size of warehouses,
may be more successful than its predecessor, for it is not only
property that is at stake, but human life. In many of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
"Manchester warehouses," there are fifty or one hundred and
upwards of warehousemen and servants sleeping in the upper
floors, whose escape, in case of fire, would be very doubtful,
to say the least of it.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>Covering timber with sheet-iron is very often resorted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
as a protection against fire. I have never found it succeed;
but Dr. Faraday, Professor Brande, Dr. D. B. Reid, and Mr.
W. Tite, M.P., are of opinion that it may be useful against a
sudden burst of flame, but that it is worse than useless
against a continued heat.</p>

<p>In wadding manufactories the drying-rooms were frequently
lined with iron-plates, and when a fire arose there,
the part covered with iron was generally found more damaged
than the rest; the heat got through the sheet-iron, and
burnt the materials behind it, and there was no means of
touching them with water until the iron was torn down;
sheet iron should not, therefore, be used for protecting wood.</p>

<p>Even cast iron, one inch thick, laid on tiles and cement
three inches thick, has allowed fire to pass through both, to
the boarding and joisting below, merely from the fire in an
open fire-place being taken off and laid on the hearth. This
arises from iron being so good a conductor that, when heat
is applied to it, it becomes in a very short time nearly as hot
on the one side as the other. If the smoke escapes up a
chimney, or in any other way, there may be a serious amount
of fire before it is noticed.</p>

<p>In a fire at the Bank of England, the hearth on which the
stove was placed was cast iron an inch thick, with two-and-a-half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
inches of concrete underneath it; but the timber below
that was fired.</p>

<p>With regard to the subject of fire-proof dwelling-houses of
average size, I consider that such houses when built of brick
or stone, with party-walls carried through the roof; the partitions
of brick, the stairs of slate or stone, the joists of
wrought iron filled in with concrete, and the whole well
plastered, are practically fire-proof because, as stated at the
opening of this chapter, there is no probability that the furniture
and flooring in any one room would make fire enough
to communicate to another. The safest manner of heating
such houses is with open fire-places, the hearths not being
laid upon timber. Stone staircases, when much heated, will
fracture from cold water coming suddenly in contact with
them; but in a dwelling-house built as described above, there
is very little chance of such a circumstance endangering
human life, even with wooden steps carried upon brick walls,
and rendered incombustible by a ceiling of an inch and a
quarter of good hair mortar and well pugged, all the purposes
of safety to human life would be attained.</p>

<p>There is a particular description of floor, which, although
not altogether fire-proof, is certainly (at least so far as I can
judge), almost practically so for dwelling-houses. It is composed
simply of plank two and a-half or three inches thick,
so closely joined, and so nicely fitted to the walls, as to be
completely air-tight. Its thickness and its property of being
air-tight, will be easily observed to be its only causes of
safety. Although the apartment be on fire, yet the time required
to burn through the floor above or below, will be so
great, that the property may be removed from the other
floors, or, more probably, if the means of extinguishing fire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
be at hand, it may be subdued before it can spread to any
other apartment. The doors must of course be made in
proportion, and the partitions of brick or stone.</p>

<p>Before closing the subject of fire-proof structures, I will
add a few words upon fire-proof safes. These are all constructed
with double casings of wrought iron, the interstices
being in some filled with non-combustible substances, such as
pumice stone and Stourbridge clay, and in others with metal
tubes, that melt at a low temperature, and allow a liquid
contained in them to escape, and form steam round the box,
with the intention of preventing the heat from injuring the
contents. Such safes I have never found destroyed; and in
some cases, after large fires, the whole of the contents have
been found uninjured, while the papers in common safes,
merely made strong enough to prevent their being broken
into, were generally found consumed.</p>

that a fire took place, in 1827, in a mill belonging to Mr. Marshall, of

Warehouses in the Metropolitan Docks, Mr. Braidwood made the following
suggestions which are applicable to all large buildings. That all the
party-walls where the roofs do not rise above the wall, should be 3 feet
6 inches above such roof. That all the party-walls in the valleys of the
roofs should be raised to the level of the highest ridge on either side, all
openings in such walls being closed by wrought-iron doors on each side
of the walls, at least a quarter of an inch thick in the panels, and such
openings not to exceed 42 superficial feet in the clear. That all windows
which look upon other windows, or loop-hole doors in other warehouses or
compartments, within 100 feet, should be bricked up, or have wrought-iron
shutters at least 3/16th of an inch thick in the panels.
</p><p>
That all loop-hole doors similarly situated should be made entirely of
wrought iron, frames included, or bricked up. That all shafts for lifts or
other purposes, should be of brick, with wrought-iron doors where necessary
to receive or deliver goods, and that all openings whatever for
machinery should be included in such shaft. That every hatchway
or opening in the floors for "shooting" goods from floor to floor should
have a strong flap <i>hinged on</i> to the floor, to be closed when not in use,
especially at night.
</p><p>
That there should be direct access to every room, of every compartment,
of every warehouse, from a fire-proof staircase, by iron doors, and that all
such staircases should enter from the open air, as well as from under any
warehouse on the quay; in the latter case the doors must be of iron
only.
</p><p>
All the windows in the entresol and ground floors to be bricked up, or
have iron shutters, and the doors and frames to be of iron.
</p><p>
Wherever the warehouses face each other within 100 feet, the front
parapet walls to be carried up to the level of the ridge of the roof.
</p><p>
When it is stated in this report that the windows or loop-hole doors
should be bricked up, it is not meant to exclude the use of thick glass,
three or four pieces being built into each door or window space, not exceeding
6 inches in diameter or square, in the clear, and set in the mortar or
cement at least 3/4 of an inch all round, the glass to be not less than 1-1/2 inches
thick, flat on both sides, and so placed that no goods can be stored within
18 inches of the inner surface.
</p><p>
There should be a tank on the top of each staircase, with a tap from
it on each landing, with six fire buckets hung near it, and three small
hand pumps in every staircase; the officers and workpeople seeing these
every day would be certain to run to them in case of fire, and by having
a constant supply of water on every floor small accidents might be extinguished
at once, and the iron doors and roofs kept cool in case of one
room taking fire.</p></div>

<h2><a name="FIRE_EXTINCTION" id="FIRE_EXTINCTION"></a>FIRE EXTINCTION,</h2>

<h4>INCLUDING</h4>

<h2>FIRE BRIGADES, FIRE ENGINES,</h2>

<h4>AND</h4>

<h2>WATER SUPPLY.</h2>


<p>Before entering upon the subject of Public Fire Brigades,
I will call attention to the course to be pursued by inmates
of the house on fire, and their neighbours.</p>

<p>When all available means of fire prevention have been
adopted, the next thing to be considered is a supply of water.
In the country, or where there are no water-pipes or engines,
this ought to be particularly attended to, and a hand-pump
should be provided. Where no water is kept solely for the
purpose of extinguishing fire, such vessels as can be spared
should be regularly filled every night, and placed in such situations
as may be most convenient in case of danger; and no
master of a family ought to retire to rest, without being
satisfied that this has been attended to. If it had no other
advantage than merely that of directing the inmates of a
house to the possibility of such an occurrence as fire, it
would be worth much more than the trouble such an
arrangement would cost; but, in addition to that, a supply of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
water would be at hand, in most cases more than sufficient
to extinguish the fire immediately on its being discovered,
and before it had become either alarming or dangerous. But
when no such precaution has been adopted, when even the
bare possibility of fire has not been considered, when no
attention has even been paid to the subject, and no provision
made for it; the inhabitants are generally so alarmed
and confused, that the danger is probably over, by their property
being burned to the ground, before they can sufficiently
recollect themselves to lend any effective assistance.</p>

<p>In most cases of fire, the people in whose premises it occurs
are thrown into what may be called a state of temporary derangement,
and seem to be actuated only by a desire of
muscular movement, no matter to what purpose their exertions
are directed. Persons may often be seen toiling like
galley-slaves, at operations which a moment's reflection would
show were utterly useless. I have seen tables, chairs, and
every article of furniture that would pass through a window,
three or four stories high, dashed into the street, even when
the fire had hardly touched the tenement. On one occasion
I saw crockery-ware thrown from a window on the third
floor.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>Most of these extravagances take place on the first alarm.
When the engines have got fairly into play, people begin to
recollect themselves, and it is at this time that most of those
"who go to see a fire" arrive. By the exertions of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
police there is then generally a considerable degree of order
restored, and the most interesting part of the scene is over.</p>

<p>What remains, however, may, from its novelty or grandeur,
if the fire is extensive, be still worth looking at for a little,
but much of the excitement is banished with the confusion;
and if the fire and firemen seem to be well matched, the chief
interest which is excited in the spectators is to ascertain
which of the parties is likely to be victorious. Few people,
comparatively, have thus an opportunity of witnessing the
terror and distraction occasioned by the first alarm of fire,
and this may probably account for the apathy and indifference
with which people who have not seen this regard it.</p>

<p>When a fire actually takes place, every one should endeavour
to be as cool and collected as possible; screams, cries,
and other exhibitions of terror, while utterly useless in
themselves, have generally the effect of alarming those whose
services might otherwise be of the utmost advantage, and of
rendering them unfit for useful exertion. It is unhappily,
too, at the commencement of fires, that this tendency to confusion
and terror is the strongest, when a bucket of water,
properly applied, is generally of more value than a hundred
will be half an hour afterwards. It is the feeling of total
surprise, on the breaking out of a fire, which thus unhinges
the faculties of many individuals. They have never made
the case their own, nay, one would almost imagine they had
scarcely thought such an occurrence possible, till, coming on
them almost like a thunderbolt, they are lost in perplexity
and terror. The only preventive against this is to think the
matter over frequently and carefully before it occurs.</p>

<p>The moment it is ascertained that fire has actually taken
place, notice should be sent to the nearest station where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
there is a fire-engine. No matter whether the inmates are
likely to be able to extinguish the fire themselves&mdash;this
should never be trusted to if more efficient help can be
had.</p>

<p>It is much better that an engine should be turned out
twenty times when it is not wanted, than be once too late.
This may cause a trifling expense; but even that expense is
not altogether lost, as it teaches the firemen steadiness and
coolness.</p>

<p>The person in the house best qualified for such duty
should endeavour to ascertain, with as much precision as possible,
the extent and position of the fire, while the others
collect as much water as they can. If the fire be in an
upper floor, the inmates should be got out immediately,
although the lower part of the house may generally be entered
with safety for some time. If in the lower part of
the house, after the inmates have been removed, great care
should be observed in going into any of the upper floors, as
the flames very often reach the stair before being observed
by those above. The upper floors are, besides, generally
filled with smoke, and, in that case, there is great danger of
suffocation to those who may enter.</p>

<p>This, indeed, is the principal danger attending fires, and
should be particularly guarded against, as a person, when
being suffocated, is unable to call for assistance. In a case
of this kind the fire took place in the third floor from the
street, and all the inmates immediately left the premises
except one old woman. In about fifteen minutes after the
arrival of the engines, the firemen made their way upstairs,
and the poor woman was found dead beside a basket partly
filled with clothes, which it was supposed she had been packing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
up for removal; had she made any noise, or even broke
a pane of glass, she would, in all probability, have been
saved; as the fire never touched the floor in which she was
found, she must have died entirely from suffocation, which a
little fresh air would have prevented. Had the slightest
suspicion existed that any one was in the upper floors, they
would have been entered by the windows or the roof; but
as the fire took place in daylight, and none of the neighbours
spoke of any one being in the house, it was thought
unnecessary to damage the property, or risk the lives of the
firemen, without some adequate cause. This, however,
shows how little dependence can be placed on information
received from the inmates of the premises on fire. Some of
the people who lived on the same floor with this poor
woman, and who had seen her immediately before they left
the house, never mentioned her. I do not suppose that this
negligence arose from apathy, or any feeling of that sort;
but the people were in such a state of utter confusion, that
they were unable to think of anything. But to return.</p>

<p>On the first discovery of a fire, it is of the utmost consequence
to shut, and keep shut, all doors, windows, or other
openings. It may often be observed, after a house has been
on fire, that one floor is comparatively untouched, while
those above and below are nearly burned out. This arises
from the door on that particular floor having been shut, and
the draught directed elsewhere. If the person who has
examined the fire finds a risk of its gaining ground upon
him, he should, if within reach of fire-engines, keep everything
close, and await their arrival, instead of admitting air
to the fire by ineffectual efforts to oppose it with inadequate
means. In the meantime, however, he should examine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
where a supply of water is most likely to be obtained, and
communicate that, and any other local information, to the
firemen on their coming forward. If there be no fire-engine
within reach, the person who has examined the fire should
keep the place where it is situated as close as possible, till as
many buckets of water as can be easily collected are placed
within his reach.</p>

<p>Taking care always that there is some one ready to assist
him, he should then open the door, and creep forward on his
hands and knees till he gets as near the fire as possible; holding
his breath, and standing up for a moment to give the
water a proper direction, he should throw it with force, using
a hand pump if available, and instantly get down to his
former position, where he will be again able to breathe. The
people behind handing forward another bucket of water, he
repeats the operation till the fire is quenched, or until he
feels exhausted; in which case some one should take his
place. If there be enough of water, however, two, three, or
any convenient number of people may be employed in throwing
it; on the contrary, if the supply of water be insufficient
to employ even one person, the door should be kept shut
while the water is being brought, and the air excluded as
much as possible, as the fire burns exactly in proportion to
the quantity of air which it receives.</p>

<p>One great evil, and which ought to be strictly guarded
against by people not accustomed to fire, is, that on the first
alarm they exert themselves to the very utmost of their
strength. This, of course, can last but a short time; and
when they feel tired, which in that case soon happens, they
very often give up altogether. Now this is the reverse of
what it ought to be. In extinguishing fires, like most other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
things, a cool judgment and steady perseverance are far more
effective than any desultory exertions which can be made.</p>

<p>The heat generally increases in a considerable degree when
water is first thrown upon a fire, from the conversion of a
portion of it into steam. This is sometimes very annoying;
so much so, that the persons engaged in throwing the water,
frequently feel themselves obliged to give back a little. They
should on no account, however, abate or discontinue their
exertions in throwing the water with as much force as
possible in the direction of the fire; it will in a short time
cool the air and materials, and the steam will, in consequence,
be generated more slowly, while a steady perseverance on the
part of those employed can alone effect the object in view.</p>

<p>When water is scarce, mud, cow or horse dung, damp
earth, &amp;c., may be used as substitutes; but if there seems no
chance of succeeding by any of these, and the fire is likely
to extend to other buildings, the communication should be
immediately cut off by pulling down the building next to
that on fire. Any operation of this sort, however, should be
begun at a sufficient distance from the fire to allow the communication
to be completely cut off, before it gains upon the
workmen. If this operation be attempted so near the fire as
to be interrupted by it, it must be begun again at a greater
distance; and, in that case, there is a greater destruction of
property than might have been necessary.</p>

<p>If a fire occur in a stable or cow-house, surrounded with
other buildings of the same description, or with the produce
of a farm, there is much danger. The cattle and horses
should be immediately removed; and, in doing so, if any of
them become restive, they should be blindfolded, taking care
that it is done thoroughly, as any attempt to blindfold them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
partially, only increases the evil. They should be handled
as much as possible in the ordinary manner, and with great
coolness; the violent gestures and excited appearance of the
persons removing them tending greatly to startle the animals,
and render them unmanageable.</p>


<h3>PUBLIC FIRE BRIGADES AND THE DUTIES OF FIREMEN.</h3>

<p>The best public means of arresting fires is a very wide
question, as the only limit to the means is the expense.
Different nations have different ways of doing the same
thing. On the Continent generally, the whole is managed
by Government, and the firemen are placed under martial
law, the inhabitants being compelled to work the engines.
In London, the principal means of arresting fires is a voluntary
association of the insurance companies, without legal
authority of any sort, the legal protection by parish
engines being, with a few praiseworthy exceptions, a dead
letter.</p>

<p>In Liverpool, Manchester, and other towns, the extinction
of fires by the pressure of water only, without the use of
fire-engines, is very much practised. The advantages of this
system are very great; but, to enable us to follow this
system in London, the whole water supply would require to
be remodelled.</p>

<p>In America, the firemen are generally volunteers, enrolled
by the local Governments. They are exempt from other
duties, or are entitled to privileges, which appear to satisfy
them, as the situation of fireman is eagerly sought in most
of the American cities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Which is the best of these different modes it is difficult
to say; perhaps each is best suited for the place where it
exists.</p>

<p>It is now generally admitted, that the whole force brought
together to extinguish a fire ought to be under the direction
and control of one individual. By this means, all quarrelling
among the firemen about the supply of water, the
interest of particular insurance companies, and other matters
of detail, is avoided. By having the whole force under
the command of one person, he is enabled to form one
general plan of operations, to which the whole body is subservient;
and although he may not, in the hurry of the
moment, at all times adopt what will afterwards appear to
be the best plan, yet it is better to have some general
arrangement, than to allow the firemen of each engine to
work according to their own fancy, and that, too, very
often in utter disregard as to whether their exertions
may aid or retard those of their neighbours. The individual
appointed to such a situation ought not to be
interfered with, or have his attention distracted, except by
the chief authority on the spot, or the owner of the premises
on fire. Much valuable information is frequently obtained
from the latter, as to the division of the premises, the party-walls,
and other matters connected with its locality. But,
generally speaking, the less interference and advice the
better, as it occupies time which may generally be better
employed.</p>

<p>I need scarcely add, that on no account whatever should
directions be given to the firemen by any other individual
while the superintendent of brigade is present; and that
there may be no quarrelling about superiority, the men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
should be aware on whom the command is to devolve in his
absence.</p>

<p>It has often been to me a matter of surprise, that so small
a portion of the public attention should be directed to the
matter of extinguishing fires. It is only when roused by
some great calamity that people bestir themselves; and then
there is such a variety of plans proposed to avert similar
cases of distress, that to attempt to concoct a rational plan
out of such a crude, ill-digested, and contradictory mass of
opinion, requires more labour and attention than most people
are inclined to give it, unless a regular business was made
of it. In Paris the corps of military firemen are so well
trained, that although their apparatus is not so good as it
should be, the amount of the losses by fire is comparatively
trifling. If the head-quarters of such an establishment were
to be in London, a store of apparatus, constructed on one
uniform plan, could be kept there, to be forwarded to any
other part of the kingdom where it might be required. This
uniformity of the structure and design of the apparatus could
extend to the most minute particulars; a screw or a nut of
any one engine would fit every other engine in the kingdom.
A dep&ocirc;t could also be kept at head-quarters, where recruits
would be regularly drilled and instructed in the business,
and a regular system of communication kept up with all the
provincial corps. Any particular circumstances occurring
at a fire would thus be immediately reported, and the advantages
of any knowledge or experience thus gained, would
be disseminated over the whole kingdom. As the matter at
present stands one town may have an excellent fire-engine
establishment, and another within a few miles a very indifferent
one, and when the one is called to assist the other,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
they can neither act in concert, nor can the apparatus of the
one in case of accident be of the smallest service in replacing
that of the other. The best might (if a proper communication
were kept up) be under frequent obligations to the
worst, and here, as in other matters, it is chiefly by communication
that knowledge is increased. If the whole experience
of the country were brought together, and maturely
considered and digested by persons competent to judge, I
have no doubt that a system might be introduced suitable to
the nation and to the age in which we live. Instead of hearing
of the "<i>dreadful losses by fire</i>," and the "<i>great exertions</i>"
made to extinguish it, all the notice would be, such a place
took fire, the engines arrived, and it was extinguished.</p>

<p>It would be useless for me to enter into the details of a plan
which I have little hope of ever seeing realized. I may state,
however, that a premium might be offered for the best engine
of a size previously agreed upon, which, when finished,
should be kept as a model.</p>

<p>Specifications could then be made out, and estimates advertised
for, for all the different parts, such as wheels, axles,
levers, cisterns, barrels, air-vessels, &amp;c., separately. When
any particular part of an engine was damaged, it could be
immediately replaced, and the engine again rendered fit for
service; and upon emergency any number of engines could
be set up, merely by putting the different parts together.
The work would also be better done; at least it would be
much more easy to detect faults in the materials or workmanship
than if the engines were bought ready for use. These
remarks apply to all the rest of the apparatus.</p>

<p>It could be provided that firemen might be enlisted for a
term of years. When enlisted, they would be sent to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
dep&ocirc;t at head-quarters, drilled to the use of the engines, and
carefully instructed in separating and cleaning the different
parts. Here also they could be practised in gymnastic exercises,
and generally instructed in everything tending to promote
their usefulness as firemen. They could then be sent
off to some large towns, and, after having seen a little active
service, distributed over the country in such parties as might
be deemed necessary for the places they were intended to
protect.</p>

<p>The practice of keeping fire-engines at noblemen's and gentlemen's
residences, and at large manufactories in the country,
is by no means uncommon, and I have no doubt that many
more would supply themselves in this way if they knew
where to apply for information in such matters; but the
great fault lies in the want of persons of skill and experience
to work them when fire occurs. In the way I have mentioned,
proprietors and others could have one or more of their
workmen instructed in this necessary piece of duty; and I
have no doubt that many gentlemen would avail themselves
of the means of instructing some of their servants.</p>

<p>It will be observed, I do not propose that the firemen who
are enlisted, drilled, and instructed in the business, should
be sent to the different stations in sufficient numbers to work
the engines; this part of the work can be performed by any
man accustomed to hard labour, as well as by the most expert
fireman, and the local authorities could easily provide
men for this purpose. In small towns, where fires are rare,
the novelty would draw together plenty of hands; and in
large towns, where the inhabitants are not sufficiently disinterested
to work for nothing, there are always plenty who
could be bound to assist in cases of fire at a certain rate per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
hour, to be paid upon a certificate from the fireman who has
charge of the engine at which they worked. The trained
firemen would thus be required only for the direction of the
engine, attaching the hose, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I am quite aware that many people object to the training
of firemen; but it would be just as reasonable to give to a
mob all the "mat&eacute;riel" of war, and next day expect it to act
like a regular army, as to expect engines to be managed with
any general prospect of success, unless the men are properly
trained and prepared for the duty which is expected from
them. Fire is both a powerful and an insidious enemy, and
those whose business it is to attack it will best succeed when
they have become skilful and experienced in the use of their
arms.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that a fire brigade, however complete
in its apparatus and equipments, must depend for its efficiency
on the state of training and discipline of the firemen.
Wherever there is inexperience, want of co-operation, or
confusion amongst them, the utmost danger is to be apprehended
in the event of fire. It is amidst the raging of this
destructive element, the terror and bustle of the inhabitants,
that organization and discipline triumph, and it is there, too,
that coolness and promptitude, steadiness and activity, fearlessness
and caution, are peculiarly required; but, unfortunately,
it is then also that they are most rarely exhibited.</p>

<p>There should not be less than five or six men attached to
each engine, who should be properly instructed and drilled,
to take charge of it, and to guide the people who work at
the levers.</p>

<p>The person having the principal charge of the engines
should frequently turn over in his mind what might be the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
best plan, in such and such circumstances, supposing a fire to
take place. By frequently ruminating on the subject, he
will find himself, when suddenly turned out of bed at night,
much more fit for his task than if he had never considered
the matter at all. Indeed he will frequently be surprised,
when examining the premises afterwards (<i>which he ought
always to do, and mark any mistakes he may have committed</i>),
that he should have adopted the very best mode of extinguishing
the fire, amid the noise, confusion, and the innumerable
advices showered down on him, by all those who
consider themselves qualified or entitled to give advice in
such matters; a number, by the way, which sometimes includes
no inconsiderable portion of the spectators. He
should also make himself well acquainted with the different
parts of the town in which he may be appointed to act, and
notice the declivities of the different streets, &amp;c. He will
find this knowledge of great advantage.</p>

<p>Any buildings, supposed to be particularly dangerous,
should be carefully examined, and all the different places
where supplies of water can be obtained for them noticed.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the locality thus obtained will be found of
great advantage in case of a fire breaking out. Indeed all
firemen, especially those having the charge of engines, should
be instructed carefully to examine and make themselves
acquainted with the localities of their neighbourhood or district.
Such knowledge will often prove valuable in emergencies;
the proprietors or tenants of the property on fire
being sometimes in such a state of alarm, that no distinct
intelligence can be got from them.</p>

<p>When an engine is brought to a fire, it ought to be placed
as nearly as possible in a straight line between the supply of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
water and the premises on fire; taking care, however, to
keep at such a distance from the latter that the men who
work the pumps may be in no danger from being scorched
by the heat, or of being annoyed by the falling of water or
burning materials. Running the engine close upon the fire
serves no good purpose, except to shorten the quantity of
hose that would otherwise be required. The addition of
twenty or thirty feet of hose makes very little difference in
the working of the engine, and, when compared with the
disadvantage of the men becoming unsteady from the idea of
personal danger, is not even to be named. Indeed, if the
engine be brought too near the fire, there is danger of the
men quitting the levers altogether. I may also add that,
both for the safety of the hose and the convenience of the
inhabitants, the engine should be kept out of the way of
people removing furniture.</p>

<p>When the hose is attached and the engine filled with
water, the man who holds the branch-pipe, accompanied by
another, should get so near the fire, inside the house, <i>that the
water from the branch may strike the burning materials</i>. If
he cannot accomplish this standing, he must get down on his
hands and knees and creep forward, those behind handing up
the hose. A stratum of fresh air is almost always to be depended
on from six to twelve inches from the floor, so that if
the air be not respirable to a person standing upright, he
should instantly get down. I have often observed this fact,
which indeed is well known; but I once saw an example of
it which appeared to me to be so striking, that I shall here
relate it. A fire had broken out in the third floor of a house,
and when I reached the top of the stair, the smoke was
rolling in thick heavy masses, which prevented me from seeing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
six inches before me. I immediately got down on the floor;
above which, for a space of about eight inches the air seemed
to be remarkably clear and bright. I could distinctly see
the feet of the tables and other furniture in the apartment;
the flames in this space burning as vivid and distinct as the
flame of a candle, while all above the smoke was so thick that
the eye could not penetrate it. The fire had already burst
through three out of five windows in the apartment, yet,
when lying flat on the floor, no inconvenience was felt except
from the heat.</p>

<p>When the fire has broken through a floor, the supply of
air along that floor is not to be depended on&mdash;the fire
drawing the principal supply of air from the apartments
below.</p>

<p>When the two first firemen have gained a favourable position,
they should keep it as long as they are able; and when
they feel exhausted, the men behind them should take their
place.</p>

<p>The great point to which everything ought to be made
subservient is, <i>that the water on its discharge from the branch-pipe
should actually strike the burning materials</i>. This cannot
be too often or too anxiously inculcated on every one connected
with a fire-engine establishment. Every other method
not having this for its grand object, will, in nine cases out
of ten, utterly fail; and upon the degree of attention paid to
this point, depends almost entirely the question as to the
amount of damage the fire will occasion.</p>

<p>When approaching a fire, it should always be done by the
door, if possible. When this is attended to, it is much easier
to shift the hose from one apartment to another; and the
current of fresh air, entering by the door and proceeding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
along the passages, makes respiration easier and safer than
elsewhere.</p>

<p>When entrance by the door is impracticable, and access is
to be gained by a window, the flames frequently burst through
in such a manner as to render advance in the first instance
impossible. In that case, the branch should be pointed
against the window, nearly in a perpendicular direction; the
water striking the lintel, and falling all round inside the
window, will soon extinguish the fire at that point sufficiently
to render an entrance practicable.</p>

<p>The old plan of standing with the branch pipe in the
street, and throwing the water into the windows is a very
random way of going to work; and for my own part,
although I have seen it repeatedly tried, I never saw it
attended with success. Indeed it is hardly to be expected
that water, thrown from the street into a room three or four
storeys high, can have any impression on closets, presses, or
passages, divided probably with brick partitions in the centre
of the house. The circumstance of having engines at work
on both sides of the house does not alter the case. The fire
very often burns up through the centre, and frequently,
when the space between the windows is large, along the
front or back wall, till it arrives at the roof, which the water
cannot touch on account of the slates or tiles. On the other
hand, when the firemen enter the house, the fire is almost
wholly under their command. And when it happens that
there is any corner which the water cannot directly strike,
the fire in it may often be extinguished by throwing the
water against an opposite wall or partition, and trusting to
the recoil to throw it to the point required.</p>

<p>When the water is thrown from the street, it is impossible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
to say whether it touches the parts on fire or not. No one
can tell anything about it, except when the flame appears at
the windows.</p>

<p>On going with the branch inside the house, besides the
advantage of the water rushing directly from the hose upon
the fire, there is a great saving in the article of water itself.
The whole that is thrown by the engine is applied to the
right purpose. No part of it is lost; that which does not
strike the burning materials falls within the house; and, by
soaking those parts on which it falls, prevents their burning
so rapidly when the flames approach them.</p>

<p>If, on entering an apartment, it be found that the flames
cover a considerable space, it is of advantage, in some
instances, to place the point of the thumb in contact with
the water at the nozzle of the branch. By this means the
water may be spread to cover any space under twenty or
thirty feet, according to the pressure applied.</p>

<p>While speaking of the mode of entering houses on fire, I
may mention that I have tried several inventions for the
purpose of elevating the branch pipe and hose to the level of
a second or third story window. But these, although
exceedingly ingenious, appear to me to rest on a principle
entirely wrong; I mean that of throwing water on the fire
from the outside of the building.</p>

<p>Independent altogether of a mistaken principle of usefulness,
one insuperable objection to all these machines, is
the difficulty of conveying them with the necessary celerity,
and the impossibility of packing them on the engine in such
a manner that it may be worked without their being taken
off, as it seems to me <i>that every description of apparatus
which cannot be conveyed along with the engine, is likely to be</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
<i>left behind when most wanted</i>. It is notorious that parish
fire-ladders are, for this reason, seldom or never made use of.</p>

<p>Many people object to going inside a building on fire on
account of the danger. It ought never to be forgotten, however,
that the danger increases with the delay; and that
although at first there may be no danger, if the opportunity
is not promptly seized, it may become very considerable.</p>

<p>Several of the firemen have at different times fainted, or
become stupefied, from the want of fresh air; but as no one
is ever allowed to enter singly, they have been, in all cases,
immediately observed by their comrades, and relieved.</p>

<p>Another objection has been raised in the alleged difficulty
of persuading men to risk their lives in this manner for the
small consideration which is allowed them. The truth is,
that any persuasions I have had occasion to use, have been
generally on the other side.</p>

<p>To hold the branch is considered the post of honour; and
when two engines are working together, I have sometimes
difficulty in preventing the men from pressing forward farther
than is absolutely necessary. This forwardness is not the
result of pecuniary reward for the increase of risk, but a
spirit of emulation is at work, and the man entrusted with
this duty, if found drawing back, would be completely disgraced.</p>

<p>A retreat should in all cases be kept open, to provide
against any accident that may occur; and as this may be done
in almost all cases by means so easy and simple, there can be
no excuse for its omission. At the same time no one but an
expert fireman should be permitted to enter where there is
personal danger.</p>

<p>The danger to which firemen are most exposed is catching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
cold, from their being so frequently drenched with water, and
from their exposure to the sudden alternations of heat and
cold. A man is turned out of bed at midnight, and in a few
minutes after quitting it he is exposed to the sharp air,
perhaps, of a frosty winter night; running to the fire as fast
as he can, he is, from the exercise, joined to the oppressive
heat inside the place on fire, in a few minutes in a state of
the most profuse perspiration; and, while in this state, he is
almost certain to be soaked with cold water. The smoke is
sometimes so thick, that he comes under the range of the
branch of the engine without being aware of it till the
water strikes him. If he escape this chance, the water
rushing on some other object, recoils on him, and produces
the same effect; and if the fire be in the roof of the apartment,
he must lie down on his back on the floor, and in this
manner gets completely steeped.</p>

<p>A bath of this sort is neither very safe nor pleasant; and
the only preventive of injury to the health is to keep the
men in constant motion. When they are allowed to stand
still or sit down, the danger is considerable. When the fire
is extinguished, or in two or three hours after its commencement,
I make it a rule to give every man a dram of spirits.
If it be necessary to leave an engine on the spot, those of
the men who are to remain are sent home to change their
clothes.</p>


<h3>THE LONDON FIRE BRIGADE.</h3>

<p>The London Fire Brigade now (January, 1861) consists of
one superintendent, four foremen, each being appointed to a
district consisting of a fourth part of London, which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
never leaves except on some very pressing emergency, and
who, in the absence of the superintendent, has the sole command
of all engines, or firemen, within, or who may come
within, his district; twelve engineers, ten sub-engineers,
forty-seven senior firemen, and forty-three junior firemen:
in all, one hundred and seventeen individuals. In addition,
there are fifteen drivers and thirty-seven horses,
all living at the several stations, and ready when required.
There is also a supplementary force of four extra
firemen, four drivers, and eight horses living at the
stations, pursuing their usual avocations, and only paid
by the Committee when required. The mechanical appliances
consist of twenty-seven large engines drawn by
horses, eight small engines drawn by hand, two floating-engines
worked by steam, one of forty-horse power, and the
other of eighty-horse power, one land steam fire-engine, and
twenty-eight hand-pumps, one of the latter being carried on
each engine. When an engine is sent to a fire, only four
firemen and one driver accompany it. The levers are worked
by the by-standers, who are paid one shilling for the first
hour, and sixpence for each succeeding hour, besides refreshments.
Upwards of six hundred assistants have been thus
employed at one time. The principal protection of London
against fire is entirely voluntary on the part of the insurance
companies, to whom the above establishment belongs;
there being no law in any shape whatever to control or sustain
the brigade; and with the exception of some fifteen or
twenty, the parish-engines are comparatively useless at a
serious fire. It must not be omitted, that the greatest possible
assistance is given to the firemen by the police, of whom
there are about 7000, in keeping back the crowd, &amp;c. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
fire-offices look upon the whole as a matter of private
business, so that the brigade is proportioned quite as must
to the amount which the offices think it prudent to spend as
to the size of the place. Paris, which is not half the size of
London, and the buildings of which are much more substantial,
has upwards of 800 firemen. It appears to me
that any success which the brigade may have attained
depends, in a great measure, on the liberal pay given, by
which the best men for the purpose can be obtained, the
favourable view in which the brigade is regarded by the
public, and the willing and able assistance given by a
numerous and perhaps the best police in existence.</p>

<p>The firemen in London being constantly employed on
weekly wages, give their whole time to their employers, and
are much more under command than where men are only
occasionally employed. The wages and treatment being
liberal, although the discipline is severe, there are generally
a considerable number of candidates for each vacancy. Thus
good men are obtained, seamen being preferred, as they are
taught to obey orders, and the night and day watches and
the uncertainty of the occupation are more similar to their
former habits, than to those of other men of the same rank
in life. The large number of fires is, however, the principal
cause of any advantage the London firemen may possess over
those of smaller places; and it is hardly fair to compare firemen
who have only an opportunity of attending one or two
fires in a week, to those who attend nearly three fires a
day.</p>

<p>The firemen are drilled first daily, and then two or three
times a week, for some months; and this, with an average
of three calls a day, soon makes them acquainted with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
routine of their business; but it takes years of constant
work to make a thoroughly good fireman.</p>

<p>The management of the London Fire Brigade is confided
to a Committee, consisting of one of the directors or secretaries
from each of the fire-offices in London.</p>

<p>The superintendent has the command of the whole force.</p>

<p>The town is divided into four districts, in each of which
there are stationed a sufficient number of engines, under the
charge of a foreman, with engines and firemen under him.</p>

<p>The districts are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h4>NORTH SIDE OF RIVER.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>District A. From the eastward to Paul's Chain, St. Paul's
Churchyard, Aldersgate-street, and Goswell-street-road.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 3em;">B. From St. Paul's, &amp;c., to Tottenham-court-road,
Crown-street, and St. Martin's-lane.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 3em;">C. From Tottenham-court-road, &amp;c., westward.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 3em;">D. South side of River.</span></p></div>

<p>The men are clothed uniformly; are distinguished by
numbers corresponding with their names in the books; and
regularly exercised in the use of their engines, and in such
other duties as the Committee or Superintendent may direct.</p>

<p>The following general regulations do not contain rules
of conduct applicable to every variety of circumstance that
may occur to individuals in the performance of their duty, as
something must always be left for the exercise of intelligence
and discretion; and, according to the degree in which these
qualities in members of the Establishment are combined with
zeal and activity, they become entitled to future promotion
and reward.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>It is strongly impressed upon the minds of all persons
serving in the Establishment, that one of the greatest advantages
which the present system possesses above that which
it superseded, is derived from the embodying the whole force
under one responsible officer. It is, therefore, incumbent
upon the men to render prompt and cheerful obedience to
the commands of their superiors; to execute their duties as
steadily and quietly as possible; to be careful not to annoy
the inhabitants of houses they may be called upon to enter,
and to treat all persons with civility; to take care to preserve
presence of mind and good temper, and not to allow
themselves to be distracted from their duty by the advice
or directions of any persons but their own officers, and
to observe the strictest sobriety and general regularity of
behaviour.</p>

<p>As every man wears the uniform of the Establishment,
which is marked with a number corresponding with his name
in the books, he must constantly bear in mind that misconduct
will not only reflect discredit upon the Establishment,
but be easily brought home to himself and subject him to
proportional punishment.</p>

<p>The men are particularly cautioned not to take spirituous
liquors from any individual without special permission of the
superintendent, or, in his absence, of the foreman of the
district; and as intoxication upon the alarming occasion of
fires is not only disreputable to the Establishment, but in
the highest degree dangerous, by rendering the men unfit
for duty, every appearance of it is most rigidly marked, and
the foremen, engineers, and sub-engineers report immediately,
for the purpose of being laid before the Committee,
every instance of insubordination or intoxication, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
men are accordingly apprised that the regulations regarding
the above-mentioned faults will be most strictly enforced.</p>

<p>All the men in the Establishment are liable to be
punished by fine, suspension, reduction, or dismissal, for
disobeying or neglecting any of these regulations, or for
any other misconduct; and the disposal of the fines so
collected is at the discretion of the Committee.</p>

<p>The following are the conditions upon which each man is
admitted into the Establishment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He devotes his whole time to the service.</p>

<p>He serves and resides wherever he is appointed.</p>

<p>He must promptly obey all orders which he may receive
from those placed in authority over him.</p>

<p>The age of admission does not exceed twenty-five, nor is
under eighteen.</p>

<p>He conforms himself to all regulations which may be
made from time to time.</p>

<p>He does not upon any occasion, or under any pretence
whatever, take money from any person, without the express
permission of the Committee.</p>

<p>He appears at all times in the dress of the Establishment.</p>

<p>If lodgings be found for him, a deduction of one shilling
per week is made from his pay, if unmarried; if
married, and if lodgings be found for him, an agreement
in each particular case will be made.</p>

<p>He receives his pay weekly on such day as shall be appointed.</p>

<p>The pay of a Junior Fireman is 3<i>s.</i> per day, or 21<i>s.</i> a week.</p>

<p>The pay of a Senior Fireman, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day, or 24<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
week.</p>

<p>The pay of a Sub-Engineer is 26<i>s.</i> a week.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>The pay of an Engineer, 4<i>s.</i> a day, or 28<i>s.</i> a week.</p>

<p>The Foremen are paid by annual salaries.</p>

<p>Each man contributes towards a Superannuation Fund,
according to a scale determined by the Committee.</p>

<p>Each man receives annually&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">One short frock coat, marked with a number answering to his name in the books.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A black neckcloth.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Two pairs of cloth trousers.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">One cloth cap.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Four pairs of boots in three years, and</span><br />
</p>

<p>Once in three years he receives&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">One great coat.</span><br />
</p>

<p>He does not quit the service without giving fourteen days'
previous notice; if he quits without such notice, or is
dismissed, the whole of his pay then due is forfeited.</p>

<p>Every man who is dismissed from the Establishment, or
who resigns his situation, delivers up, before he quits
the service, every article of dress and appointment which
may have been supplied to him; if any of such articles
have been, in the opinion of the superintendent, improperly
used or damaged, the man makes good the
damage or supplies a new article.</p>

<p>Every man in the service is liable to immediate dismissal
for unfitness, negligence, or misconduct. The Committee,
if they see fit, may dismiss a man without
assigning any reason.</p>

<p>No fireman must allow to be used by any other person,
nor use himself, except while he belongs to the Establishment,
the button and badge given with his clothes.</p>

<p>In the event of sickness rendering any man incapable of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
performing his duties, the Committee reserves to itself
the power of making a deduction from his weekly pay.</p>

<p>Each man, on his admission, gives to the Committee, if
required, a letter of guarantee from some respectable
person, to an amount not exceeding 50<i>l.</i>, as security.</p></div>


<h4>OUTLINE OF GENERAL DUTY.</h4>

<p>One-third of the men are constantly on duty at the
different engine-houses, night and day; and the whole are
liable to be called up for attendance at fires, or for any other
duty. In general, it is arranged as follows, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>If a fire happen in District A, the whole of the men and
engines of that district immediately repair to the spot;
two-thirds of the men, and one of the engines, from each of
the districts B and D, also go to the fire; and one-third of
the men from the district C.</p>

<p>If the fire happen in B, the whole of the men and engines
in that district immediately repair to the fire; one engine
from A, another from C, two-thirds of the men from A and
C, and one-third of the men from D.</p>

<p>If the fire happen in C, the whole of the men and engines
in that district, one engine and two-thirds of the men from
the district B, and one-third of the men from A and D, go
to the fire.</p>

<p>If the fire happen in D, the whole of the men and engines
in that district, with one engine and two-thirds of the men
from the district A, and one-third of the men from B and C,
shall go to the fire.</p>

<p>If a fire happen on the boundary of a district, and it is
doubtful in which district it has occurred, the whole of the
engines and men of the two adjoining districts instantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
proceed to the spot, and one-third of the men of the two
remaining districts.</p>

<p>In case of emergency, the superintendent calls in such
additional force as he may require.</p>

<p>The engines are not taken to alarms of chimneys on fire,
unless the circumstances of the case should, in the opinion of
the superintendent, foreman, or engineer, require a deviation
from this regulation.</p>

<p>When any of the men from another district come to assist
at a fire, if the engine to which they are attached is not
in attendance, they instantly go to the foreman's engine of
the district to which they come.</p>

<p>The engines are conveyed to fires at not less than seven
miles per hour, and the men who do not accompany the
engines go at not less than four miles per hour.</p>

<p>Any engineer or fireman who, when at a fire, is absent
from an engine or a branch pipe, without orders from the
superintendent or foreman, is liable to a fine.</p>

<p>If any of the men are sick, or absent from any other cause,
their duties are performed by other men attached to their
engine-station.</p>

<p>With a view to the men being always at hand, they are
lodged as near as possible to their respective engine-houses.</p>

<p>The roll is called at each station every morning and
evening.</p>

<p>No man leaves his own residence or the engine-station to
which he belongs from 10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> to 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> except to go to a
fire, or by an order from a superior, or with written leave
from the superintendent, and the senior man on duty is
answerable if he does not report any departure from this
rule.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>Men on duty not at the engine-stations are allowed one
hour for breakfast and one for dinner, as follows:&mdash;One-half
of the men on duty go to breakfast from 8 to 9, and
the other half from 9 to 10; also one-half go to dinner
from 1 to 2, and the other half from 2 to 3. The second
half in no case leave until the whole of the first half have
returned, neither do the men on duty leave morning or
evening until the relief has arrived. The engineer or senior
man on duty is answerable for this regulation being carried
into effect. And any man being absent from the premises
he is watching or working in, except at the regular hours, is
punished.</p>

<p>The men for duty individually assemble at the principal
engine-house in the district before, or precisely at, the hour
fixed for that purpose. Their names are called, and an inspection
made by the foreman of the district, to ascertain
that they are sober and correctly dressed and appointed.
The foreman then reads and explains the orders of the day.
At the hour for relieving the men, no one leaves his engine-house
until the relief has actually arrived there; when the
men are relieved, their names are called over, and they are
inspected by the engineer, that he may ascertain whether
they are sober, and as correctly dressed and appointed as
when they went on duty. The engineer enters these inspections
in a book.</p>

<p>The engineers deliver a written report, according to a
printed form, twice each day, to the foreman of the district,
who in his turn reports twice a day to the superintendent.</p>

<p>The whole of the men are, at all times, ready to appear at
any place required, for exercise or any other purpose, and
are ready (whether on duty or not) to execute whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
orders they may receive, in relation to the Establishment,
from the engineers, foremen, or superintendent.</p>


<h4>DUTIES OF SUPERINTENDENT.</h4>

<p>The Superintendent resides at the principal engine-station
in Watling-street.</p>

<p>The moment an alarm of fire is given, wherever it may be,
he repairs to the spot with all possible expedition, and takes
the command of the whole force.</p>

<p>He endeavours to ascertain the cause of the fire, and
reports the same to the committee.</p>

<p>He is responsible for the general conduct of the foremen,
engineers, and firemen under his charge.</p>

<p>He makes himself well acquainted with the character and
conduct of every man under his orders.</p>

<p>He must be firm and just, and, at the same time, kind
and conciliating in his behaviour on all occasions.</p>

<p>He takes care that the printed regulations and all others
given out from time to time, are promptly and strictly
obeyed; and he gives clear and precise instructions to the
men under him, and reports every instance of neglect of a
serious nature to the Committee.</p>

<p>He must feel the importance of visiting some of the
engine-houses, at uncertain hours, every day and night.</p>

<p>He suspends and reports to the Committee persons who
are guilty of serious misconduct; and at once punishes by
fines, according to a scale sanctioned by the Committee, irregularities
of a lighter character, reporting such fines to them.</p>

<p>He must be at all times prepared to furnish the Committee
with particulars respecting the state of the Establishment.</p>

<p>When a fire is extinguished, the superintendent retains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
only such a number of men and engines as he may think
necessary for watching the premises.</p>

<p>He communicates with the surveyors of stock of the
offices interested in a fire, and arranges with them, in the
event of its being necessary, to work out salvage from the
ruins.</p>

<p>When a fire happens, he causes a report to be made immediately,
if in office hours (or, if after office hours, before
ten o'clock next morning), to those offices interested in the
fire, and also to their surveyors of buildings and stock, as
soon as possible after the fire is extinguished, and causes a
daily report to be transmitted to each office of all fires which
have happened, according to a printed form given to him for
that purpose, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul><li>Date and hour.</li>

<li>Situation of premises.</li>

<li>Name and occupation of tenant.</li>

<li>Name and residence of landlord.</li>

<li>Supposed cause of fire.</li>

<li>In what offices insured.</li>

<li>No. of Policy.</li>

<li>If there is gas on the premises.</li>

<li>By whom called.</li>

<li>By whom extinguished.</li>

<li>Supply of water, with name of company.</li>

<li>No. of engines attending and of what district, and the order in which they arrive.</li>

<li>No. of men ditto          ditto.</li>

<li>Engines not of the Establishment, and the order in which they arrive.</li>

<li>Description of damage.</li>
</ul>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<h4>DUTIES OF FOREMAN.</h4>

<p>The Foreman resides at the place appointed for him.</p>

<p>He receives his orders and instructions from, and makes
his reports to, the superintendent.</p>

<p>He must set an example to the men of alacrity and skill
in the discharge of his duty, and of regularity in his general
behaviour.</p>

<p>In the absence of the superintendent, the foreman of the
district will take the command of the whole force, both those
of his own district and of all other engines and men which
may come to his assistance in cases of fire.</p>

<p>He does not attend fires that happen out of his own district
unless he receives orders from the superintendent to
that effect.</p>

<p>He endeavours to ascertain the cause of the fire, and
reports the same to the superintendent.</p>

<p>On the alarm of fire being given in his own district, he
instantly repairs to the spot, and uses his utmost endeavours
to get the engines into play and supply them with water.
The first engine and firemen which arrive at a fire are not
interfered with, nor their supplies of water diverted from
them, by those coming afterwards, unless by a distinct order
from the superintendent, or, in his absence, from the foreman
of the district. The same rule applies to each succeeding
engine which takes up a position.</p>

<p>He is careful to place the engines in such a manner that
the men who work at the levers may be in no danger from
the falling of the premises on fire; and also that the engines
may not be in the way of people carrying out furniture, &amp;c.;
but, above all things, he endeavours to place the engineers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
with their branch pipes in such positions <i>that the water from
the branches may directly strike the burning materials</i>. This
he cannot too often inculcate on the men placed under him, as
upon this point, on being properly attended to, depends
entirely the effect of the engines. To attain this most
desirable end, it is frequently necessary to enter the premises
on fire, and the foreman takes care so to place his men that
they can easily escape. If he has reason to suspect that the
building is not sufficiently secure, he stations one or two
competent men to observe the state of the building, and to
give the alarm when they see any danger.</p>

<p>He never allows any man unaccompanied by another to
enter a building on fire.</p>

<p>He does not throw more water on the premises than is
absolutely necessary to extinguish the fire, as all the water
thrown after the fire is extinguished, only tends to increase
the damage.</p>

<p>When the inmates of the premises on fire are removed,
the foreman endeavours to exclude air from the parts on fire,
by shutting all doors and windows as far as may be practicable.</p>

<p>He is responsible for the conduct of the men placed under
him, and for the state of the engines, which must at all
times be kept in first-rate order; he also makes himself well
acquainted with the talent and general character of each
individual under him.</p>

<p>He visits every engine-house in his district at least once
in the twenty-four hours; he sees that the men are on duty,
the engines ready for service, and everything in proper
order, and enters his visit in a book kept for that purpose,
with the date and hour of his visit. If he finds anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
wrong, he enters it in the book, and immediately sends off a
report to the superintendent by one of the men not on duty.</p>

<p>He sends a written report twice in every twenty-four
hours to the superintendent, which contains a particular
statement of all fires and everything else connected with the
Establishment which has occurred in his district within the
preceding twelve hours.</p>

<p>He returns in his report of a fire the names of such men,
if any, as were not ready to start with the engine to which
they are attached.</p>

<p>It is expected that he is able and ready to give instructions
to the engineers and men on all points relating to their
duty.</p>

<p>He receives and enters, in a book kept for that purpose,
all complaints which may be made against any person under
his command, causing the complaining party to sign the
same and insert his address, and he reports the whole matter
without delay to the superintendent.</p>

<p>He is responsible for the engines in his district being each
provided with the articles contained in the following list:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>2 lengths of scaling ladder.</li>

<li>1 canvas sheet, with 10 or 12 handles of rope round the edge of it, used as a portable fire-escape.</li>

<li>2 pieces of 2-1/2-inch rope, one 10 fathoms and one 14 fathoms long.</li>

<li>7 lengths of hose, each 40 feet long.</li>

<li>2 branch pipes, one 4 and the other 1 foot long.</li>

<li>3 nozzles, or jet pipes.</li>

<li>4 lengths of suction-pipe, each about 6 feet long.</li>

<li>1 flat rose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></li>

<li>1 standcock.</li>

<li>1 goose-neck.</li>

<li>2 balls of strips of sheep-skin.</li>

<li>2 balls of small cord.</li>

<li>4 hose wrenches.</li>

<li>1 fire hook.</li>

<li>1 mattock.</li>

<li>1 shovel.</li>

<li>1 saw.</li>

<li>1 screw-wrench.</li>

<li>1 portable cistern.</li>

<li>1 hatchet or pole-axe.</li>

<li>1 iron crow-bar.</li>
</ul>



<h4>DUTIES OF THE ENGINEER.</h4>

<p>He resides in the engine-house to which he is appointed.</p>

<p>He obeys all orders given to him by the superintendent
or the foreman of the district.</p>

<p>He must set an example to the men of alacrity and skill
in the discharge of his duty, and of regularity in his general
behaviour.</p>

<p>He is held responsible for the conduct of the men under
him, and for the state of his engine, and takes care that it
is provided with the articles contained in the foregoing list.</p>

<p>He reports to his foreman, every morning and evening,
in writing, whether any of his men have been absent with
or without leave.</p>

<p>He enters in his book the time when the men go to the
foreman's station before taking duty, and also when they
return.</p>

<p>On receiving notice of a fire happening within the prescribed
limits, he instantly takes his engine and men to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
spot, and places himself and them at the disposal of the
superintendent, foreman, or senior engineer of the district in
which the fire happens.</p>

<p>He must make himself acquainted with the character and
abilities of each man under him.</p>

<p>He is subject to fines at the discretion of the Committee,
for neglect of duty or misbehaviour.</p>


<h4>DUTIES OF SUB-ENGINEERS.</h4>

<p>The sub-engineers being attached to foremen's and double
stations only, in the absence of the foremen or engineer,
or when in charge of an engine, the duties of the sub-engineer
are the same as those described for an engineer;
when the foreman or engineer is absent, the sub-engineer
must set an example to the firemen at the station of constant
attention, implicit obedience and activity, and in so
far as he exhibits these and similar qualifications he expects
to rise in the service.</p>


<h4>DUTIES OF THE FIREMAN.</h4>

<p>Every fireman in the establishment may expect to rise to
the superior stations, by activity, intelligence, sobriety, and
general good conduct.</p>

<p>He must make it his study to recommend himself to
notice by a diligent discharge of his duties, and strict obedience
to the commands of his superiors, recollecting that he
who has been accustomed to obey will be considered best
qualified to command.</p>

<p>He resides near the engine-house to which he is attached,
in a situation to be approved of, and devotes the whole of
his time and abilities to the service.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>On the alarm of fire, he proceeds with all possible speed
to the engine-house to which he is attached.</p>

<p>He must at all times appear neat in his person, and correctly
dressed in the establishment uniform, and be respectful
in his demeanour towards his superiors.</p>

<p>He must readily and punctually obey the orders of the
engineers, foremen, and superintendent.</p>

<p>He must not quit his engine-house while on duty, except
to go to a fire, unless by special order from a superior.</p>

<p>He is subject to fines for neglect of duty or misbehaviour,
according to the regulations.</p>


<h4>BOOKS KEPT AT THE STATIONS.</h4>

<p>There is a book kept in each engine-house, in which are
entered all fires or alarms of fires; the time the men come
on duty; the visits made by the foremen, superintendent, or
any of the Committee, and all complaints against the men.</p>

<p>This book is in charge of the superior on duty at the
time; and the foreman and engineers are answerable for its
being correctly kept.</p>

<p>Every entry made in this book is signed by the person
making it.</p>

<p>The superintendent enters, in a book kept for that purpose,
the particulars of every fire, the attendance of engines,
supply of water, &amp;c., and lays it before the Committee
weekly, or oftener, if required.</p>

<p>Any false entry, for the purpose of concealing absence, is
punished&mdash;for the first offence, by the reduction of one step,
and for the second by dismissal.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_EDINBURGH_FIRE_BRIGADE" id="THE_EDINBURGH_FIRE_BRIGADE"></a>THE EDINBURGH FIRE BRIGADE.</h3>


<p>In forming the brigade in Edinburgh, where the firemen
are only occasionally employed, the description of men, from
which I made a selection, were slaters, house-carpenters,
masons, plumbers, and smiths.</p>

<p>Slaters make good firemen, not so much from their superiority
in climbing, going along roofs, &amp;c., although these are
great advantages, but from their being in general possessed
of a handiness and readiness which I have not been able to
discover in the same degree amongst other classes of workmen.
It is, perhaps, not necessary that I should account for
this, but it appears to me to arise from their being more dependent
on their wits, and more frequently put to their shifts
in the execution of their ordinary avocations. House-carpenters
and masons being well acquainted with the construction
of buildings, and understanding readily from whence
danger is to be apprehended, can judge with tolerable accuracy,
from the appearance of a house, where the stair is
situated, and how the house is divided inside. Plumbers are
also well accustomed to climbing and going along the roofs
of houses; they are useful in working fire-cocks, covering
the gratings of drains with lead, and generally in the management
of water. Smiths and plumbers can also better
endure heat and smoke than most other workmen.</p>

<p>Men selected from these five trades are also more robust
in body, and better able to endure the extremes of heat, cold,
wet, and fatigue, to which firemen are so frequently exposed,
than men engaged in more sedentary employments.</p>

<p>I have generally made it a point to select for firemen,
young men from seventeen or eighteen to twenty-five years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
of age. At that age they enter more readily into the spirit
of the business, and are much more easily trained, than
when farther advanced in life. Men are frequently found
who, although they excel in the mechanical parts of their
own professions, are yet so devoid of judgment and resources,
that when anything occurs which they have not been taught,
or have not been able to foresee, they are completely at a
loss. Now it happens not unfrequently that the man who
arrives first at a fire, notwithstanding any training or instructions
he may have received, is still, from the circumstances
of the case, left almost entirely to the direction of
his own judgment. It is, therefore, of immense importance
to procure men on whose coolness and judgment you can depend.
If they are expert tradesmen, so much the better, as
there is generally a degree of respect shown to first-rate
tradesmen by their fellows, which inferior hands can seldom
obtain; and this respect tends greatly to keep up the character
of the corps to which they belong, which ought never
to be lost sight of.</p>

<p>Amidst the noise and confusion which more or less attend
all fires, I have found considerable difficulty in being able to
convey the necessary orders to the firemen in such a manner
as not to be liable to misapprehension. I tried a speaking-trumpet;
but, finding it of no advantage, it was speedily
abandoned. It appeared to me indeed, that while it increased
the sound of the voice, by the deep tone which it
gave, it brought it into greater accordance with the surrounding
noise. I tried a boatswain's call, which I have
found to answer much better. Its shrill piercing note is so
unlike any other sound usually heard at a fire, that it immediately
attracts the attention of the firemen. By varying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the calls, I have now established a mode of communication
not easily misunderstood, and sufficiently precise for the circumstances
to which it is adapted, and which I now find to
be a very great convenience.</p>

<p>The calls are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1 for red, 2 for blue, 3 for yellow, 4 for grey.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></li>

<li>5 to work the engine.</li>

<li>6 to stop working.</li>

<li>7 to attach one length of hose more than the engine has at the time the call is given.</li>

<li>8 to coil up the hose attached to the engine.</li>

<li>9 to coil up the hose attached to the fire-cock.</li>

<li>10 to turn to the left.</li>

<li>11 to turn to the right.</li>

<li>12 the call to work the engine answers also to move forward when the engine is prepared for travelling.</li>

<li>13 the call to stop working answers to stop the engine when moving forward.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all there are thirty-six calls when compounded with the
first four.</p>

<p>In speaking of the drilling of firemen, I shall give a short
account of the plan followed here, which has been tolerably
successful.</p>

<p>The present number of firemen in Edinburgh is fifty,
divided into four companies; three of which consist of
twelve and one of fourteen men. The bounds of the city
are divided into four districts; in each of which there is an
engine-house, containing one or more engines, one of the
companies being attached to each engine-house. In each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
company there is one captain, one sergeant, four pioneers, and
six or eight firemen.</p>

<p>The whole are dressed in blue jackets, canvas trousers, and
hardened leather helmets, having hollow leather crests over
the crown to ward off falling materials. The form of this
helmet was taken from the war-helmet of the New Zealanders,
with the addition of the hind flap of leather to prevent
burning matter, melted lead, water, or rubbish getting
into the neck of the wearer. The captains' helmets have
three small ornaments, those of the sergeants one&mdash;those of
the pioneers and firemen being plain.</p>

<p>The jackets of the captains have two small cloth wings on
the shoulder, similar to those worn by light infantry. Those
of the sergeants have three stripes on the left arm, and, on
the left arms of the pioneers and firemen, are their respective
numbers in the company. Each company has a particular
colour&mdash;red, blue, yellow, and grey. Each engine is painted
of one or other of these colours, and the accoutrements of
the men belonging to it correspond. There is thus no difficulty
in distinguishing the engines or men from each other by
their colours and numbers. Each man also wears a broad
leather waist-belt, with a brass buckle in front. To the
waist-belts of the captains, sergeants, and pioneers is attached
eighty feet of cord; the captains having also a small mason's
hammer, with a crow-head at the end of the handle: the
sergeants have a clawed hammer, such as is used by house-carpenters,
with an iron handle, and two openings at the end
for unscrewing nuts from bolts; the pioneers a small
hatchet, with a crow-head at the end of the handle; and the
firemen each carry a canvas water-bucket folded up.</p>

<p>The captains assemble every Tuesday night, to give in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
report of such fires as may have occurred in their respective
districts, with a list of the men who have turned out, and a
corresponding list from the sergeant of police of the respective
districts. They then receive any orders which may
be necessary; and any vacancies which have occurred in the
establishment are filled up at these meetings.</p>

<p>For some months after this fire establishment was
organized, the men were regularly drilled once a week, at
four o'clock in the morning; but now only once a month at
the same hour.</p>

<p>Among many other good reasons for preferring this early
hour, I may mention, that it does not interfere with the
daily occupation of the firemen. The chance of collecting a
crowd is also avoided, as there are then comparatively few
people on the streets; this is a matter of some importance,
as a crowd of people not only impedes the movements of the
firemen, but, from small quantities of water spilt on the by-standers,
quarrels are generated, and a prejudice excited
against the corps, to avoid which every exertion should be
used to keep the firemen on good terms with the populace.</p>

<p>The mornings, too, at this early hour, are dark for more
than half the year, and the firemen are thus accustomed to
work by torch-light, and sometimes without any light whatever,
except the few public lamps which are then burning.
And, as most fires happen in the night, the advantage of
drilling in the dark must be sufficiently obvious.</p>

<p>The inhabitants have sometimes complained of being disturbed
with the noise of the engines at so early an hour;
but when the object has been explained, they have generally
submitted, with a good grace, to this slight evil. A different
part of the city being always chosen for each successive drill,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the annoyance occasioned to any one district is very trifling,
and of very unfrequent occurrence.</p>

<p>On the Tuesday evening preceding the drill, the captains
are informed when and where the men are to assemble.
These orders they communicate to the individual firemen. A
point of rendezvous being thus given to the whole body,
every man, who is not on the spot at the hour appointed,
fully equipped, with his clothes and accoutrements in good
order, is subjected to a fine. Arrived on the ground, the
men are divided into two parties, each party consisting of
two companies, that being the number required to work
each large engine without any assistance from the populace.
The whole are then examined as to the condition of their
clothing and equipments.</p>

<p>The captains, sergeants, and pioneers of each company
alternately take the duty of directing the engine, attaching
the hose, &amp;c., while the whole of each party not engaged in
these duties take the levers as firemen. The call is then
given to move forward, the men setting off at a quick walking
pace, and, on the same call being repeated, they get into
a smart trot. When the call to stop is given, with orders to
attach one or more lengths of hose to the engine and fire-cock,
it is done in the following manner:&mdash;No. 1 takes out
the branch pipe, and runs out as far as he thinks the hose
ordered to be attached will reach, and there remains; No. 2
takes a length of hose out of the engine, and uncoils it
towards No. 1; and No. 3 attaches the hose to the engine.
If more than one length is required, No. 4 takes out another,
couples it to the former length, and then uncoils it. If a
third length is wanted, No. 3 comes up with it, after having
attached the first length to the engine. If more lengths are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
still wanted, No: 2 goes back to the engine for another;
Nos. 3 and 4 follow, and so on till the requisite length is obtained;
No. 1 then screws on the branch-pipe at the farther
extremity of the last length.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> While Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4
are attaching the hose to the engine, No. 5 opens the fire-cock
door, screws on the distributor, and attaches the length
of hose, which No. 6 uncoils; Nos. 7 and 8 assist, if more
than one length of hose be required. Immediately on the
call being given to attach the hose, the sergeant locks the
fore-carriage of the engine, and unlocks the levers. The
fire-cock being opened by No. 5 (who remains by it as long
as it is being used), the sergeant holds the end of the hose
which supplies the engine, and at the same time superintends
the men who work the levers. The call being given to work
the engine, the whole of the men, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the
captain and sergeant excepted, work at the levers along with
the men of the other company.</p>

<p>Although these operations may appear complicated, they
are all completed, and the engine in full play, with three
lengths, or 120 feet of hose, in one minute and ten seconds,
including the time required for the water to fill the engine so
far as to allow it to work.</p>

<p>In order to excite a spirit of emulation, as well as to teach
the men dexterity in working the engines, I frequently cause
a competition amongst them. They are ordered to attach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
one or more lengths of hose to each of two engines, and to
work them as quickly as possible, the first engine which
throws water being considered the winner. They are sometimes
also placed at an equal distance from each of two
separate fire-cocks; on the call being given to move forward,
each party starts for the fire-cock to which it is ordered, and
the first which gets into play is of course held to have beat
the other. The call to stop is then given, and both parties
return to their former station, with their hose coiled up, and
everything in proper travelling order; the first which arrives
being understood to have the advantage.</p>

<p>The men are also carefully and regularly practised in
taking their hose up common-stairs, drawing them up by
ropes on the outside, and generally in accustoming themselves
to, and providing against, every circumstance which
may be anticipated in the case of fire.</p>

<p>When a fire occurs in a common-stair, the advantages
arising from this branch of training are incalculable. The
occupants, in some cases amounting to twenty or thirty
families, hurrying out with their children and furniture,
regardless of everything except the preservation of their
lives and property, and the rush of the crowd to the scene of
alarm, form altogether, notwithstanding the exertions of an
excellent police, such a scene of confusion as those only who
have witnessed it can imagine; and here it is that discipline
and unity of purpose are indispensable; for, unless each man
has already been taught and accustomed to the particular duty
expected from him, he only partakes of the general alarm, and
adds to the confusion. But even when a hose has been
carried up the interior of a common-stair, the risk of damage
from the people carrying out their furniture is so great, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the hose is not unfrequently burst, almost as soon as the
engine has begun to play. If the hose be carried up to the
floor on fire by the outside, the risk of damage is comparatively
small, the hose in that case being only exposed for a
short distance in crossing the stair.</p>

<p>During a period of four years the only two firemen who
lost their lives were run down by their own engines; and, in
order to avoid danger from this cause, they are frequently
accustomed suddenly to stop the engines when running down
the steep streets with which this city abounds. It is a
highly necessary exercise, and is done by wheeling the engine
smartly round to the right or left, which has the effect of
immediately stopping its course.</p>

<p>There is a branch of training which I introduced amongst
the Edinburgh firemen some time ago, which has been
attended with more important advantages than was at first
anticipated. I mean the gymnastic exercises. The men
are practised in these exercises (in a small gymnasium fitted
up for them in the head engine-house) regularly once a-week,
and in winter sometimes twice: attendance on their part is
entirely voluntary; the best gymnasts (if otherwise equally
qualified) are always promoted in cases of vacancy.</p>

<p>So sensible were the Insurance Companies doing business
here, of the advantages likely to arise from the practice of
these exercises, that on one occasion they subscribed upwards
of 10<i>l.</i>, which was distributed in medals and money among
the most expert and attentive gymnasts of the corps, at a
competition in presence of the magistrates, commissioners of
police, and managers of insurance companies.</p>

<p>Amongst the many advantages arising from these exercises
I shall notice only one or two. The firemen, when at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
their ordinary employments, as masons, house-carpenters, &amp;c.,
being accustomed to a particular exercise of certain muscles
only, there is very often a degree of stiffness in their general
movements, which prevents them from performing their duty
as firemen with that ease and celerity which are so necessary
and desirable; but the gymnastic exercises, by bringing all
the muscles of the body into action, and by aiding the more
general development of the frame, tend greatly to remove or
overcome this awkwardness. But its greatest advantage is
the confidence it gives to the men when placed in certain
situations of danger. A man, for example, in the third or
fourth floor of a house on fire, who is uncertain as to his
means of escape, in the event of his return by the stair being
cut off, will not render any very efficient service in extinguishing
the fire; his own safety will be the principal
object of his attention, and till that is to a certain extent
secured, his exertions are not much to be relied upon. An
experienced gymnast, on the other hand, placed in these circumstances,
finds himself in comparative security. With a
hatchet and eighty feet of cord at his command, and a
window near him, he knows there is not much difficulty in
getting to the street; and this confidence not only enables
him to go on with his duty with more spirit, but his
attention not being abstracted by thoughts of personal
danger, he is able to direct it wholly to the circumstances of
the fire. He can raise himself on a window sill, or the top
of a wall, if he can only reach it with his hands; and by his
hands alone he may sustain himself in situations where
other means of support are unattainable, till the arrival of
assistance. These are great advantages; but, as I said
before, the greatest of all is that feeling of safety with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
which it enables a fireman to proceed with his operations,
uncertainty or distraction being the greatest of possible
evils. The cord carried at the waist-belt of the captains,
sergeants, and pioneers, being fully sufficient to sustain a
man's weight, and with the assistance of their small hatchets
easily made fast, and the pioneers always being two together,
there is thus no difficulty in descending even from a height of
eighty feet: the cords should be doubled by way of security.</p>


<h4>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">General Regulations of the Edinburgh Fire
Brigade.</span></h4>

<p>A list of the engine-houses, and the residences of the
superintendent and head enginemen in each district shall be
publicly advertised, that no one may be ignorant where to
apply in cases of fire; and, in the event of fire breaking out
in any house, the possessor shall be bound to give instant
notice of it at the nearest station; and shall take particular
care to keep all doors and windows shut in the premises
where the fire happens to be.</p>

<p>"Fire-engine house" shall be painted in large characters on
one or more prominent places of each engine-house; and the
residences of the master of engines, head enginemen, inspectors
of gas companies, and water-officers of the district, shall
likewise be marked there.</p>

<p>The head enginemen and firemen shall reside as near the
engine-house as possible.</p>

<p>As, in the case of a fire breaking out, it may be necessary
to break open the doors of houses and shops in the neighbourhood,
in order to prevent the fire from spreading, it is
ordered, that no possessors of houses or shops in the neighbourhood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
shall go away, after the fire has broken out, without
leaving the key of their house or shop, as otherwise the door
will be broken open, if necessary; and it is recommended
that all possessors of shops shall have the place of their residence
painted upon their shop-doors, that notice may be sent
them when necessary.</p>


<h4>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Police.</span></h4>

<p>Upon any watchman discovering fire, he shall call the
neighbouring watchmen to his assistance&mdash;shall take the best
means in his power to put all concerned upon their guard&mdash;and
shall immediately send off notice to the nearest office
and engine-house. The watchman, who is despatched to give
these intimations, shall run as far as he can, and shall then
send forward any other watchman whom he may meet, he
himself following at a walk to communicate his information,
in case of any mistake on the part of the second messenger.</p>

<p>Upon intimation of a fire being received at the main
office, or a district office, the head officer on duty shall instantly
give notice thereof to the head engineman of the
district, to the master of engines, to the water-officers of the
district, and to the inspectors of the different gas-light companies,
and shall have power, if his force at the office at the
time be deficient, to employ the nearest watchmen for these
purposes; and, on intimation being first received at a district-office,
the officer on duty in the office shall immediately
send notice to the main office.</p>

<p>Upon intimation being received at the main office, the
officer on duty shall also instantly send notice to the superintendent
of police, and the lieutenants not at the office at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
time&mdash;to the master of engines; to the head enginemen of
the various districts; to the superintendent of the water
company; to the lord provost or chief magistrate for the
time; to the sheriff of the county; to the bailie residing
nearest the place; to the dean of guild; to the members of
fire-engine committee of commissioners of police; to the moderator
of the high constables; and also to the managers of
the different gaslight companies.</p>

<p>The officer on duty at the main office shall, with the least
possible delay, send off to the fire a party of his men, under
the command of a lieutenant or other officer.</p>

<p>This party, on arriving at the spot, shall clear off the
crowd, and keep open space and passages for the firemen and
others employed.</p>

<p>The officer commanding this party of the police shall attend
to no instructions except such as he shall receive from
the acting chief magistrate attending; or, in absence of a
magistrate, from any member of the committee on fire-engines;
and the men shall attend to the instructions of their
own officer alone.</p>

<p>Three or more policemen shall be in attendance upon the
acting chief magistrate and fire-engine committee; two policemen
shall constantly attend the master of the engines, to
be at his disposal entirely; and one policeman shall attend
with the water-officer at each fire-cock that may be opened.</p>

<p>The superintendent of police shall always have a list of
extra policemen hung up in the police-office, who, upon occasions
of fire, may be called out, if necessary, and twenty of
these extra men shall always be called out upon notice of
fire being received at the main office, for the purpose of attending
at the police-office, and rendering assistance where it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
may be required. The superintendent shall likewise have a
supply of fire-buckets, flambeaux, and lanterns, at the office,
to be ready when wanted.</p>

<p>There shall be no ringing of alarm-bells, beating of drums,
or springing of rattles, except by written order from the
chief magistrate for the time; but the alarm may be given
by despatching messengers, with proper badges, through
different parts of the town, when considered necessary.</p>


<h4>III. <span class="smcap">Superintendent of Fire Brigade.</span></h4>

<p>On receiving notice of a fire, the superintendent shall instantly
equip himself in his uniform, and repair to the spot
where the fire is.</p>

<p>The necessary operations to be adopted shall be under his
absolute control, and he will issue his instructions to the
head enginemen and firemen.</p>

<p>The superintendent shall report from time to time to the
chief magistrate in attendance (through such medium as
may be at his command, but without his leaving the spot),
the state of the fire, and whether a greater number of policemen,
or a party of the military, be required, and anything
else which may occur to him; and the master shall observe
the directions of the chief magistrate attending, and those
of no other person whatever.</p>

<p>The superintendent shall frequently inspect the engines,
and all the apparatus connected therewith; he shall be responsible
for the whole being at all times in good order and
condition; and he shall have a general muster and inspection
at least once every three months, when the engines and all
the apparatus shall be tried. He shall also instruct the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
enginemen, firemen, and the watchmen, to unlock the
plates, and screw on the distributors of the fire-cocks, or
open the fire-plugs.</p>

<p>Whenever any repairs or new apparatus shall appear to be
necessary, the superintendent shall give notice to the clerk of
the police, whose duty it shall be instantly to convene the committee
on fire-engines.</p>

<p>Upon a fire breaking out, the superintendent shall lose as
little time as possible in stationing chimney-sweepers on the
roofs of the adjoining houses, to keep them clear of flying
embers; and also persons in each flat of the adjoining
houses, to observe their state, and report if any appearances
of danger should arise; such persons taking as much care as
possible <i>to keep all doors and windows of said flats shut</i>, and
the doors and windows of the premises where the fire
happens to be shall, so far as practicable, be carefully kept
shut.</p>

<p>The superintendent shall forthwith prepare regulations for
the firemen, &amp;c., under his charge, and report the same to
the committee on fire-engines for their approval. Every
fireman shall be furnished with a copy of such regulations,
and shall be bound to make himself master of its contents;
and it shall be the duty of the superintendent to see that the
instructions are duly attended to in training and exercising
the men.</p>


<h4>IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Head Enginemen.</span></h4>

<p>Each head engineman shall attend to the engines placed
in his district, and all the apparatus connected therewith,
and report to the superintendent when any repairs or new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
apparatus seem requisite, and shall be responsible for the
engines being in proper working condition at all times.</p>

<p>Upon receiving notice of a fire, the head enginemen shall
call out the firemen in their respective districts; and they
shall all repair, perfectly equipped, with the utmost expedition,
to the spot where the fire happens to be, carrying along
with them the engines and apparatus.</p>

<p>The head enginemen shall have the carts and barrels
attached to their several districts always in readiness, in
good order, and the barrels filled with water, which shall
accompany the engines to the fire.</p>

<p>On arriving at the spot, the head enginemen shall take
their instructions from the superintendent, or, in his absence,
from the chief magistrate in attendance on the spot;
or, in their absence, from a member of the fire-engine committee,
and from no other person whatever.</p>


<h4>V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Firemen.</span></h4>

<p>The firemen shall attend at all times when required by
the head enginemen or superintendent, as well as upon the
days of general inspection. They shall keep their engines
in good order and condition, and shall be equipped in their
uniform at all times when called out.</p>

<p>They shall observe the instructions of no person whatever,
except those of the superintendent or head enginemen.</p>


<h4>VI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">High Constables and Commissioners of Police.</span></h4>

<p>Upon occasions of fire, the moderator of the high constables
shall call out the high constables, and, if necessary, he
shall also call out the extra constables, and give notice to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
call out the constables of their districts; and it shall be the
duty of the constables to preserve order and to protect
property, to keep the crowd away from the engines, and
those employed about them; and, when authorized by the
chief magistrate, superintendent of engines, or, in the
absence of a magistrate, by a member of the committee on
fire-engines, to provide men for working the engines.</p>

<p>Neither the constables nor the commissioners of police
shall assume any management, or give any directions whatsoever,
except in absence of a magistrate and the superintendent
of engines, in which case any member of the
committee on fire-engines may give orders to the head
enginemen.</p>

<p>In cases of protracted fire, when extra men may be
required to relieve the regular establishment, it shall be the
duty of the high constables to collect those wanted, from
amongst the persons on the street who may be willing to lend
their assistance, mustering them in such parties as may be
required, taking a note of their names, and furnishing each
individual with a certificate or ticket, with which the
moderator of the high constables, or chief constable at the
time, will be supplied; and no person shall receive any
remuneration for alleged assistance given at a fire who may
not produce such certificate or ticket.</p>

<p>The party or parties so mustered shall be placed and continue
under the care of two high constables, until required
for service, when they shall be moved forward to the engine.</p>

<p>The men relieved by the party so moved forward, shall
be taken charge of by two high constables, who shall see
them properly refreshed and brought back within a reasonable
time, so that the men employed may thus occasionally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
relieve each other without confusion, and without being too
much exhausted.</p>


<h4>VII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Magistrates, &amp;c.</span></h4>

<p>Upon occasion of fires, the magistrates, sheriff, moderator
of the high constables, the superintendent of the water company,
the managers of the different gas-light companies, and
the fire-engine committee, will give their attendance. They
will assemble in such house nearest to the place of the fire
as can be procured, of which notice shall be immediately
given to the officer commanding the police on the spot.</p>

<p>The orders of the chief magistrate in attendance shall be
immediately obeyed; and no order, except those issued by
such magistrate, and the particular directions given as to the
fire and engine department by the master of engines, or, in
their absence, by a member of the fire-engine committee on
the spot, shall be at all attended to.</p>

<p>The magistrates and sheriff further declare, that all
porters holding badges shall be bound to give their attendance
at fires when called upon for that purpose.</p>


<h4>VIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gas-light Companies.</span></h4>

<p>The managers of the different gas-light companies, on
receiving notice of a fire, shall instantly take measures for
turning off the gas from all shops and houses in the immediate
neighbourhood of the fire.</p>


<h4>IX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Special Regulations for the Firemen.</span></h4>

<p><i>Captains.</i>&mdash;On the alarm of fire being given, an engine
must be immediately despatched from the main office to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
whatever district the fire may be in; and the captain in
whose district the fire happens shall bring his engine to the
spot as quickly as possible, taking care that none of the
apparatus is awanting. On arriving at the spot, he must
take every means in his power to supply his engine with
water, but especially by a service-pipe from a fire-cock, if
that be found practicable. Great care must be taken to
place the engine so that it may be in the direction of the
water, with sufficient room on all sides to work it, but as
little in the way of persons employed in carrying out furniture,
&amp;c., as possible. He must also examine the fire while
the men are fixing the hose, &amp;c., that the water may be
directed with the best effect.</p>

<p>The captains shall be responsible for any misconduct of
their men, when they fail to report such misconduct to the
superintendent.</p>

<p>The engines must be at all times in good working order,
and the captain shall report to the superintendent when any
part of the apparatus is in need of repair.</p>

<p>When the fire is in another district, the captain of each
engine shall get his men and engine ready to proceed at a
moment's notice, but must not move from his engine-house
till a special order arrives from a lieutenant of police or the
superintendent of brigade.</p>

<p><i>Sergeants.</i>&mdash;The sergeant of each engine will take the
command in absence of the captain. When the captain is
present, the sergeant will give him all possible assistance in
conducting the engine to the fire; and it will there be more
particularly the sergeant's duty to see that the engine is
supplied with water, and that every man is at his proper
station, and to remain with his engine while on duty, whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
it is working or not, unless he receives special orders to the
contrary.</p>

<p><i>Pioneers.</i>&mdash;Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 of each engine will be considered
pioneers. Nos. 1 and 2 will proceed to the fire
immediately, without going to their engine-house, in order to
prepare for the arrival of the first engine, by ascertaining and
clearing a proper station for it, and by making ready the
most available supplies of water, as also to examine the state
of the premises on fire and the neighbouring ones, so as to
be able to give such information to the captain on his arrival
as may enable him to apply his force with the greatest effect.
<i>The pioneers will attend particularly to the excluding of air
from the parts on fire by every means in their power, and they
will ascertain whether there are any communications with the
adjoining house by the roof, gable, or otherwise.</i> When the
several engines arrive, the pioneers will fall in with their own
company, and take their farther orders from the captain or
sergeant.</p>

<p><i>Firemen.</i>&mdash;On the alarm of fire being given, the whole
company belonging to each engine (Nos. 1 and 2 excepted)
shall assemble as speedily as possible at their engine-house,
and act with spirit under the orders of their officers in getting
everything ready for service. Each man will get a ticket
with his own number and the colour of his engine marked
upon it; and on all occasions when he comes on duty he will
give this ticket into the hands of a policeman, who will be
appointed by the officer of police on duty to collect them at
each engine-house, and who will accompany the engine if it
is ordered to the fire.</p>

<p>If the ticket be not given in, as before provided, within
half an hour after the alarm is given at their engine-house, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
at all events, within half an hour after the arrival of the
engine at the fire, the defaulter will forfeit the allowance for
turning out, and also the first hour's pay.</p>

<p>If not given in within the first hour, he will forfeit all
claim to pay.</p>

<p>The superintendent, however, may do away the forfeiture
in any of these cases, on cause being shown to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>On quarter-days and days of exercise, every man must be
ready equipped at the appointed hour, otherwise he will forfeit
that day's pay, or such part of it as the superintendent may
determine.</p>

<p>Any man destroying his equipments, or wearing them when
off duty, will be punished by fine or dismissal from the service,
as the superintendent may determine.</p>

<p>Careless conduct, irregular attendance at exercise, or disobedience
of superior officers, to be punished as above-mentioned.</p>

<p>The man who arrives first at the engine-house to which he
belongs, <i>properly equipped</i>, will receive three shillings over
and above the pay for turning out.</p>

<p>The first of the Nos. 1 and 2 who arrives at the fire, <i>properly
equipped</i>, in whatever district it may be, will receive
three shillings over and above the pay for turning out.</p>

<p>No pay will be allowed for a false alarm, unless the same
is given by a policeman.</p>

<p>As nothing is so hurtful to the efficiency of an establishment
for extinguishing fires as unnecessary noise, irregularity,
or insubordination, it is enjoined on all to observe quietness
and regularity, to execute readily whatever orders they may
receive from their officers, and to do nothing without orders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>The first engine and company which arrive at the fire are
not to be interfered with, nor their supplies of water diverted
from them by those coming afterwards, unless by a distinct
order from the superintendent, or, in his absence, from the
chief magistrate on the spot. The same rule will apply to
each succeeding engine which takes up a station.</p>

<p>The men must be careful not to allow their attention to be
distracted from their duty by listening to directions from any
persons <i>except their own officers</i>; and they will refer every one
who applies to them for aid to the superintendent, or to the
chief magistrate present at the time.</p>

<p>All the firemen must be particularly careful to let the
policemen on their respective stations know where they live,
and take notice when the policeman is changed, that they
may give the new one the requisite information.</p>

<p>The men are particularly cautioned not to take spirituous
liquors from any individual without the special permission of
the captain of their engine, who will see that every proper
and necessary refreshment be afforded to them; and as intoxication
upon such alarming occasions is not merely disreputable
to the corps, but in the highest degree dangerous, by
rendering the men unfit for their duty, every appearance of
it will be most rigidly marked; and any man who may be
discovered in that state shall not only forfeit his whole allowances
for the turn-out and duty performed, but will be forthwith
dismissed from the corps.</p>

<p>All concerned are strictly enjoined to preserve their presence
of mind, not to lose temper, and upon no occasion whatsoever
to give offence to the inhabitants by making use of
uncivil language or behaving rudely.</p>

<p>*<sub>*</sub>* Every one belonging to the establishment will be furnished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
with a printed copy of these Regulations, which they
are enjoined carefully to preserve and <i>read over at least once
every week</i>.</p>


<h3>MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM FIRE.</h3>

<p>[The following was written in the year 1830, and does
not refer to Public Fire-Escapes other than those that can
be carried with a Fire-Engine.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>]</p>

<p>When the lower floors of a house are on fire, and the
stairs or other ordinary means of retreat destroyed, the
simplest and easiest mode of removing the inhabitants from
the upper floors, is by a ladder placed against the wall. In
order to be able at all times to carry this plan into effect, the
person having charge of the engines should (as far as possible)
inform himself where long ladders are to be had, and
how they can most easily be removed.</p>

<p>But if a ladder of sufficient length is not to be procured,
or is at too great a distance to render it safe to wait
for it, recourse must immediately be had to other means.</p>

<p>If it happens that the windows above are all inaccessible,
on account of the flames bursting through those below, the
firemen should immediately get on the roof (by means of
the adjoining houses,) and descend by the hatch. The
hatch, however, being sometimes directly above the stair, is
in that case very soon affected by the fire and smoke. If, on
approaching, it is found to be so much so as to render an
entrance in that way impracticable, the firemen should
instantly break through the roof, and, descending into the
upper floors, extricate those within. If it should happen,
however, that the persons in danger are not in the upper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
floor, and cannot reach it in consequence of the stair being
on fire, the firemen should continue breaking through floor
after floor till they reach them. In so desperate a case as
this the shorter process may probably be to break through
the party-wall between the house on fire and that adjoining,
when there is one; and when there is no house immediately
contiguous, through the gable, taking care in either case to
break through at the back of a closet, press, chimney, or
other recess, where the wall is thinnest. If an opening has
been made from the adjoining house, it should immediately
(after having served the purpose for which it was made) be
built up with brick or stone, to prevent the fire spreading.
All these operations should be performed by slaters, masons,
or house-carpenters, who, being better acquainted with such
work, are likely to execute it in a shorter time than others&mdash;time,
in such a case, being everything, as a few minutes
lost may cost the lives of the whole party. It is not impossible,
however, that circumstances may occur to render all or
either of these plans impracticable; in that case, one or two
of the lower windows must be darkened, and by this means
access gained to the upper ones. The plan recommended by
the Parisian firemen is, for a man to wrap himself up in a
wet blanket, and thus pass swiftly through the flames. But
this effort is only to be attempted when the flames from a
single door are to be passed; in any other case the stair will
most likely be in flames, and impassable.</p>

<p>A simple means of escape from fire is to have an iron ring
fastened to the window sill, and inside of the room a cradle,
with a coil of rope attached to it. The rope is put through
the ring, and the person wishing to escape gets into the
cradle, and lowers himself down by passing the rope through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
his hands. The great objection to this plan, which is certainly
very simple, is the difficulty, or rather impossibility, of
persuading people to provide themselves with the necessary
materials. Many men, too, are incapable of the exertion
upon which the whole plan depends; and if men in a state
of terror are unfit for such a task, what is to become of
women and children?</p>

<p>Any fire-escape, to be generally useful, must, in the first
place, be capable of being carried about without encumbering
the fire-engine; and, in the next place, must be of instant
and simple application. The means which appear to me to
possess these qualifications in the highest degree, is a combination
of the cradle plan, with Captain Manby's admirable
invention for saving shipwrecked seamen.</p>

<p>The apparatus necessary for this fire-escape is a chain-ladder
eighty feet long, a single chain or rope of the same
length as the ladder, a canvas bag, a strong steel cross-bow,
and a fine cord of the very best workmanship and materials,
130 feet long, with a lead bullet of three-ounce weight
attached to one end, and carefully wound upon a wooden
cone seven inches high and seven inches broad at the base,
turned with a spiral groove, to prevent the cord slipping
when wound upon it, also a small pulley with a claw
attached to it, and a cord reeved through it of sufficient
strength to bear the weight of the ladder.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the sides of the ladder from collapsing,
the steps are made of copper or iron tube, fastened
by a piece of cord passed through the tube and into the links
of the chain, till the tube is filled. The steps thus fastened
are tied to the chain with copper-wire, so that, in the event
of the cord being destroyed, the steps will be retained in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
their places by the wire. The ladder is provided with two
large hooks at one end, for the purpose of fixing it to a
roof, window-sill, &amp;c. The bag is of canvas, three feet wide
and four feet deep, with cords sewed round the bottom, and
meeting at the top, where they are turned over an iron
thimble at each side of the mouth of the bag. The steel
cross-bow is of the ordinary description, of sufficient strength
to throw the lead bullet with the cord attached, 120 feet
high.</p>

<p>When the house from which the persons in danger are to
be extricated is so situated that the firemen can get to the
roof by passing along the tops of the adjoining houses, they
will carry up the chain-ladder with them, and drop it over
the window where the inmates show themselves, fastening the
hooks at the same time securely in the roof. The firemen
will descend by the ladder into the window, and putting the
persons to be removed into the bag, lower them down into
the street by the single chain. If the flames are issuing
from the windows below, the bag, when filled, is easily drawn
aside into the window of the adjoining house, by means of a
guy or guide-rope.</p>

<p>If the house on fire stands by itself, or if access cannot be
had to the roof by means of the adjoining houses, the lead
bullet, with the cord attached, is thrown over the house by
means of the cross-bow; to this cord a stronger one is
attached, and drawn over the house by means of the former;
a single chain is then attached, and drawn over in like
manner; and to this last is attached the chain-ladder, which,
on being raised to the roof, the firemen ascend, and proceed
as before directed.</p>

<p>If the house be so high that the cord cannot be thrown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
over far enough to be taken hold of by those on the opposite
side, then the persons to be extricated must take hold of the
cord, as it hangs past the window at which they may have
placed themselves. By means of it they draw up the small
pulley, and hook it on the window-sill. The chain-ladder is
then made fast to the end of the cord, and drawn up by
those below. When the end of the chain-ladder comes in
front of the window, the persons inside fasten the hooks
of the ladder on its sill, or to the post of a bed, the bars of
a grate, or anything likely to afford a sufficient hold. After
having ascertained that the ladder is properly fixed, the firemen
will ascend and proceed as in the former cases.</p>

<p>I must here remark, that before this plan can be properly
put in execution, the firemen must be regularly trained to
the exercise. When the firemen here are practised with the
fire-escape, the man ascending or descending has a strong
belt round his middle, to which another chain is fastened,
and held by a man stationed at the window for that purpose;
if any accident, therefore, were to occur with the chain-ladder,
the man cannot fall to the ground, but would be
swung by the chain attached to the belt round his body.
The men are also frequently practised in ascending and
descending by single chains. The firemen here are very
fond of the above exercise; the bagging each other seems to
amuse them exceedingly.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p>The last resort, in desperate cases, is to leap from the
window. When this is to be attempted, mattresses, beds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
straw, or other soft substances, should be collected under the
window; a piece of carpet or other strong cloth should be
held up by ten or twelve stout men. The person in the window
may then leap, as nearly as possible, into the centre of the
cloth, and if he has sufficient resolution to take a fair leap,
he may escape with comparatively little injury.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>


<h3><a name="FIRE-ENGINES" id="FIRE-ENGINES"></a>FIRE-ENGINES.</h3>

<p>In the application of manual power to the working of
fire-engines, the principal object is, to apply the greatest
aggregate power to the lightest and smallest machine; that
is, suppose two engines of the same size and weight, the one
with space for 20 men to work throws 60 gallons per
minute; and the other, with space for 30 men, throws
80 gallons in the same time; the latter will be the most
useful engine, although each man is not able to do so much
work as at the former.</p>

<p>The reciprocating motion is generally preferred to the
rotary for fire-engines. Independent of its being the most
advantageous movement, a greater number of men can be
employed at an engine of the same size and weight; there is
less liability to accident with people unacquainted with the
work, and such as are quite ignorant of either mode of
working, work more freely at the reciprocating than the
rotary motion. To these reasons may be added, the greater
simplicity of the machinery.</p>

<p>Various sizes of engines, of different degrees of strength<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and weight, have been tried, and it is found that a fire-engine
with two cylinders of 7 inches diameter, and a stroke
of 8 inches, can be made sufficiently strong at 17-1/2 cwt. If
4 cwt. be added for the hose and tools, it will be found quite
as heavy as two fast horses can manage, for a distance under
six miles, with five firemen and a driver.</p>

</p>

<p>This size of engine has been adopted by the Board of
Admiralty and the Board of Ordnance, and its use is
becoming very general.</p>

<p>When engines are made larger, it is seldom that the
proper proportions are preserved, and they are generally
worked with difficulty, and soon fatigue the men at the
levers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 2. Transverse section.</span>
</p>

<p>When an engine is large, it not only requires a considerable
number of men to work it, but it is not easily supplied
with water; and, above all, <i>it cannot be moved about
with that celerity on which, in a fire-engine establishment,
everything depends</i>. When the engine is brought into
actual operation, the effect to be produced depends less on
the quantity of water thrown than upon its being made
actually to strike the burning materials, the force with
which it does so, and the steadiness with which the engine
is worked. If the water be steadily directed upon the
burning materials, the effect even of a small quantity is
astonishing.</p>

<p>When a large engine is required in London, two with
7-inches cylinders are worked together by means of a connecting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
screw, thus making a jet very nearly equal (as 98 to
100) to that of an engine with cylinders 10 inches diameter.</p>

<p>It is also an advantage not unworthy of consideration,
that two 7-inch engines may be had nearly for the price of
one 10-inch one; so that if one happens to be rendered
unserviceable the other may still be available.</p>

<p>The usual rate of working an engine of the size described
is 40 strokes of each cylinder per minute; this gives 88
gallons. The number of men required to keep steadily at
work for three or four hours is 26; upwards of 30 men
are sometimes put on when a great length of hose is
necessary. The lever is in the proportion of 4-1/4 to 1. With
40 feet of leather hose and a 7/8 inch jet, the pressure
is 30 lb. on the square inch; this gives 10.4 lbs. to each
man to move a distance of 226 feet in one minute. The
friction increases the labour 2-1/2 per cent. for every additional
40 feet of hose, which shows the necessity of having
the engine, and of course the supply of water, as close to
the fire as is consistent with the safety of the men at the levers.</p>

<p>In order that the reader may have a distinct idea of such
a fire-engine, I shall here endeavour to give a description,
chiefly taken from those made by W. J. Tilley,<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> fire-engine
maker, London.</p>

<p>The engravings (figs. 1 and 2) represent a fire-engine of
7-inch barrels and 8-inch stroke.<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> The cistern marked A
is made of mahogany or oak. The upper work, B, and
side-boxes or pockets, C, are of Baltic fir. The sole, D, upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
which the barrels stand, and which also contains the valves,
is of cast-iron, with covers of the same material, which
are screwed down, and the joints made good with leather or
india-rubber. The pieces E, at each end of the cast-iron
sole D, are of cast brass, and screwed to the cast-iron sole
D, with a joint the same as above. In one of these pieces
is the screwed suction-cap F, and to the other is attached the
air-vessel G, made of sheet-copper, and attached to the piece
E by a screw. The exit-pipe H is attached to the under
side of the casting E by a swivel. The valves at I are
of brass, ground so as to be completely water-tight. The
barrels K are of cast brass. The engine is set on four
grasshopper springs M. The shafts or handles O, of the
levers P, are of lancewood. The box S, under the driving
seat, is used for keeping wrenches, cord, &amp;c.; in the fore
part of the cistern A, and the box B above the cistern, the
hose is kept; the branch and suction-pipes are carried in
the side-boxes or pockets C; the rest of the tools and materials
are kept along with the above-mentioned articles, in such
situations as not to interfere with the working of the engine.</p>

<p>The cistern is made of oak or mahogany, for strength
and durability; but, for the sake of lightness, the upper
work and side-boxes are made of Baltic fir, strength in
them being of less importance.</p>

<p>As the valve cannot be made without a rise for the lid to
strike against, there is a small step at each of the valves,
and the sole is carried through as high as this step, to admit
of the water running off when the engine is done working.
If constructed in a different manner, the water will lodge in
the bottom, and produce much inconvenience in situations
where the engine is exposed to frost.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>The valve-covers are of cast-iron, fastened down with
copper screws, a piece of leather or india-rubber being placed
between them and the upper edges of the sole.</p>

<p>The pieces at each end of the sole are of cast-brass, instead
of sheet-copper, with soft-solder joints, which are very apt
to give way.</p>

<p>The screwed suction cap with iron handle admits the
water in two different directions, according as it is open
or closed: the one to supply the engine when water is
drawn from the cistern, the other for drawing water through
the suction-pipe.</p>

<p>The valves are brass plates, truly ground to fit the circular
brass orifice on which they fall. The brass being well ground,
no leather is used for the purpose of making them tight.
The longer they are used the better they fit, and by having
no leather about them they are less liable to the adhesion of
small stones or gravel. The whole valve is put together
and then keyed into a groove in the sides and bottom of the
sole, left for that purpose.</p>

<p>The barrels are of cast-brass, with a piston made of two
circular pieces of the same metal, each put into a strong
leather cup, and bolted to the other. The bottoms of the
cups being together, when the piston becomes loose in the
barrels, and there is not sufficient time to replace the cups
by new ones, they are easily tightened by putting a layer of
hemp round the piston between the leather and the brass.
This operation, however, requires to be carefully performed;
for if more hemp is put into one part than another it is apt
to injure the barrels. The barrels are fixed to the cast-iron
sole by copper screws, a little red lead being placed between
the bottom flange of the barrel and the sole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>When the engine is likely to be dragged over rough roads
or causeways, it is of importance to have it set on springs, to
prevent the jolting from affecting the working part of the
engine, everything depending on that being right.</p>

<p>The engines used in Paris are mounted on two wheels, the
carriage and the engine being separate, the latter being dismounted
from the former before it can be used. In Paris,
where the engines are managed by a corps of regularly-trained
firemen, this may answer well enough; but if hastily
or carelessly dismounted by unskilful persons, the engine may
be seriously damaged. It is also worthy of remark, that the
proper quantity of hose, tools, &amp;c., can be more easily attached
to and carried on a four-wheeled engine.</p>

<p>In order that the men may work more easily at the
handles, and suffer less fatigue, the engine is not higher than
to enable them to have the levers easily under their command.
The shafts of the levers are of lancewood, being best
calculated to bear the strain to which they are exposed when
the engine is at work, and they are made to fold up at each
end for convenience in travelling.</p>

<p>The air-vessel should be placed clear of any other part of
the engine, excepting only the point where it is attached.</p>

<p>The fore-carriage of the engine is fitted with a pole, and
is made to suit the harness of coach-horses, these being, in
large towns, more easily procured than other draught cattle;
this can be altered, however, to suit such harness as can most
readily be obtained. Where horses are seldom used to move
the engines, a drag-handle is attached, by which one or two
men are able easily to direct the progress of the engine.</p>

<p>Two drag-ropes, each twenty-five feet long, of three-inch
rope, with ten loops to each, are attached, one to each end of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the splinter-bar, by means of which the engines are dragged;
and to prevent the loops collapsing on the hand, they are
partly lined with sheet-copper.</p>

<p>The whole of the brass work of an engine should be of the
best gun-metal, composed of copper and tin only. Yellow
brass should never be used; even at first it is far inferior to
gun-metal, and after being used for some time it gets brittle.
The whole of the materials used in the construction of a fire-engine
should be of the best description.</p>

<p>In London for some years past a hand-pump has been
carried with each engine. They have been found of the
greatest service in keeping doors, windows, &amp;c., cool. They
throw from six to eight gallons per minute, to a height of
from thirty to forty feet, and can be used in any position.
The idea of the hand-pumps I took from the old-fashioned
squirt, or "hand-engine."</p>

<p>When fire-engines are unserviceable it arises more frequently
from want of care in keeping in order than from
any damage they may have received in actual service or by
the wearing out of the materials; so it is quite plain that
this important part of the duty has not generally had that
degree of attention paid to it which it deserves.</p>

<p>Although an engine were to be absolutely perfect in its
construction, if carelessly thrown aside after being brought
home from a fire, and allowed to remain in that state till the
next occasion, it would be in vain (especially in small towns,
where alarms are rare) to expect to find it in a serviceable
condition; some of the parts must have grown stiff, and if
brought into action in this state something is likely to give
way.</p>

<p>When an engine is brought back from a fire, it ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
be immediately washed, the cistern cleaned out, the barrels
and journals cleaned and fresh oil put on them, the wheels
greased, and every part of the engine carefully cleaned and
examined, and if any repairs are needed they should be
executed immediately. When all this has been attended to
clean hose should be put in, and the engine is again fit for
immediate service. Besides this cleaning and examination
after use, the engine ought to be examined and the brass part
cleaned once a week, and worked with water once a month
whether it has been used or not.</p>

<p>In addition to the keeping of the engine always in an
effective state, this attention has the advantage of reminding
the men of their duty, and making them familiar with every
part of the mechanism of the engine; thus teaching them
effectually how the engines ought to be protected when at
work, by enabling them to discover those parts most liable to
be damaged, and to which part damage is the most dangerous.
It is more troublesome generally to get the engines well kept
when there are no fires, than when there are many. But the
only effectual method of inducing the men to keep them in
good order, in addition to the moral stimulants of censure
and applause, is to fine those who have the charge of them
for the slightest neglect.</p>

<p>When the engine has been properly placed, before
beginning to work the fore-carriage should be locked. This
is done by putting an iron pin through a piece of wood
attached to the cistern, into the fore-carriage. This prevents
the wheels from turning round, and coming under the shafts,
by which the latter might be damaged, and the hands of the
men at work injured.</p>

<p>Small stones, gravel, and other obstructions, sometimes find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
their way into the nozzle of the branch-pipe, from having
dropped into the hose before being attached, or having been
drawn through the suction-pipe or from the cistern. Whenever
the engine is found to work stiffly, it should be stopped
and examined, otherwise the pressure may burst the hose, or
damage some part of the engine. If anything impedes the
action of the valves the pistons must be drawn, and if a
person's hand be then introduced they may easily be cleared&mdash;constant
care and attention to all the minuti&aelig; of the
engine and apparatus being absolutely indispensable, if
effective service be expected from them.</p>

<p>Considerable attention ought to be paid to the selecting a
proper situation for an engine-house. Generally speaking, it
ought to be central, and on the highest ground of the district
it is meant to protect, and care should be taken to observe
when any of the streets leading from it are impassable.</p>

<p>If, in addition to these advantages, the engine-house can
be had adjoining to a police watch-house, it may be considered
nearly perfect, in so far as regards situation. These
advantages being all attained, the engine can be conveyed to
any particular spot by a comparatively small number of men,
while the vicinity of a police watch-house affords a facility of
communicating the alarm of fire to the firemen not to be
obtained otherwise. When the engine-house is placed in a
low situation the men who first arrive must wait till the
others come forward to assist them to drag the engine up the
ascent, and many minutes must thus be lost at a time when
moments are important.</p>

<p>After choosing a proper situation for the engine-house, the
next care should be directed towards having it properly ventilated,
as nothing contributes more to the proper keeping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
of the engines and hose than fresh and dry air. For this
purpose a stove should be fitted up, by which the temperature
may be kept equal. When engines are exposed to
violent alternations of heat and cold, they will be found to
operate very considerably on the account for repairs, besides
occasioning the danger of the engine being frozen and unserviceable
when wanted.</p>

<p>There ought to be at least half a dozen keys for each
engine-house, which should be kept by the firemen, watchmen,
and those connected with the establishment, that the
necessity of breaking open the door may not occur.</p>


<h4>DESCRIPTION OF TOOLS WITH WHICH EACH ENGINE IS
PROVIDED.</h4>

<p>Having considered the sort of fire-engine which is best
adapted for general purposes, I shall now notice the different
articles which, in London, are always attached to, and accompany,
each engine of this kind:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>7 coils of hose, 40 feet each.</li>
<li>4 bundles of sheepskin and lay-cord.</li>
<li>4 lengths of suction-pipe, each between 6 and 7 feet long.</li>
<li>2 branch pipes.</li>
<li>3 jet pipes or nozzles and an elbow for jet.</li>
<li>3 wrenches for coupling-joints.</li>
<li>2 lamps.</li>
<li>2 lengths of scaling ladder.</li>
<li>1 fire-hook.</li>
<li>60 feet of patent line, and 20 feet of trace line.</li>
<li>1 mattock.</li>
<li>1 shovel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></li>
<li>1 hatchet or pole-axe.</li>
<li>1 saw.</li>
<li>1 iron crow-bar.</li>
<li>1 portable cistern.</li>
<li>1 flat suction strainer.</li>
<li>1 standcock, and hook for street plugs.</li>
<li>1 screw wrench.</li>
<li>1 canvas sheet with 10 or 12 rope handles round its edges.</li>
<li>9 canvas buckets.</li>
<li>1 hand-pump with 10 feet of hose and jet pipe.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these articles I shall endeavour to give a description as
they stand in the above list.</p>

<p>The article of hose being first in order, as well as importance,
merits particular attention.</p>

<p>The sort used is leather, made with copper rivets, and is by
far the most serviceable and durable hose that I have yet
seen.</p>

<p>Manufacturers of this article, however, for a very obvious
reason, are not always careful to select that part of the hide
which, being firmest, is best adapted for the purpose. Indeed,
I have known several instances wherein nearly the
whole hide has been cut up and made into hose, without any
selection whatever. The effect of this is very prejudicial.
The loose parts of the hide soon stretch and weaken, and
while, by stretching, the diameter of the pipe is increased,
the pressure of the water, in consequence, becomes greater
on that than on any other part of the hose, which is thereby
rendered more liable to give way at such places.</p>

<p>Hose are frequently made narrow in the middle, and, in
order to fit the coupling-joints, wide at the extremities&mdash;a
practice which lessens their capability of conveying a given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
quantity of water, in proportion to the difference of the
area of the section of the diameters at the extremity and
the middle part.</p>

<p>In order to make them fit the coupling-joints, when carelessly
widened too much, I have frequently seen them stuffed
up with brown paper, and in that case they almost invariably
give way, the folds of the paper destroying the hold which
the leather would otherwise have of the ridges made on the
ends of the coupling-joints.</p>

<p>In order to avoid all these faults and defects, the riveted
hose used are made in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>The leather is nine and five-eighths inches broad (that
being the breadth required for coupling-joints of two and a
half inches diameter of clear water-way), and levelled to the
proper uniform thickness. The leather used is taken from
hides of the very best description, perfectly free from flesh-cuts,
warble-holes, or any other blemish, and stuffed as high
as possible.<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> Not more than four breadths are taken from
each hide, and none of the soft parts about the neck,
shoulders, or belly are used. No piece of leather is less than
four feet long.</p>

<p>The leather is gauged to the exact breadth, and holes
punched in it for the rivets. In the operation of punching,
great care must be taken to make the holes on each side of
the leather exactly opposite to each other. If this precaution
be not attended to, the seam when riveted takes a
spiral direction on the hose, which the heads of the rivets
are very apt to cut at the folds. Care must also be taken
that the leather is equally stretched on both sides, otherwise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
the number of holes on the opposite sides may be unequal.
The ends are then cut at an angle of thirty-seven degrees;
if cut at a greater angle, the cross-joint will be too short,
and if at a smaller, the leather will be wasted. This must,
however, be regulated in some degree by the number of holes
in the cross-joint, as the angle must be altered a little if the
holes at that part do not fit exactly with the holes along the
side.</p>

<p>The different pieces of leather necessary to form one
length, or forty feet of hose, are riveted together by the
ends.</p>

<p>Straps of leather, three inches broad, are then riveted
across the pipe, ten feet apart, to form loops for the purpose
of handing or making fast the hose when full of water. The
leather is then laid along a bench, and a bar of iron, from
eight to ten feet long, three inches broad, and one inch thick,
with the corners rounded off, is laid above it. The rivets
are next put into the holes on one side of the leather, along
the whole length of the iron bar. The holes on the other
side are then brought over them, and the washers put on the
points of the rivets, and struck down with a hollow punch.
The points of the rivets are then riveted down over the
washers, and finished with a setting punch. The bar of iron
is drawn along, and the same operation repeated till the
length of the hose be finished.</p>

<p>The rivets and washers should be made of the best
wrought copper, and must be well tinned before being
used.</p>

<p>Some objections have been made to riveted hose on account
of the alleged difficulty of repairing them; but this is not
so serious a matter as may at first view appear. Indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
they very seldom require any repairs, and when they do, the
process is not difficult. If any of the rivets be damaged, as
many must be taken out as will make room for the free
admission of the hand. A small flat mandrel being introduced
into the hose, the new rivets are put into the leather,
and riveted up the same as new pipe; the mandrel is then
shaken out at the end.</p>

<p>If the leather be damaged, it may be repaired either by
cutting out the piece, and making a new joint, or by riveting
a piece of leather upon the hole.</p>

<p>The manner of attaching the hose to the coupling-joint
is also a matter of very considerable importance. If a joint
come off when the engine is in operation, a whole length of
hose is rendered useless for the time, and a considerable
delay incurred in getting it detached, and another substituted.</p>

<p>To prevent this, the hose ought to fit as tightly as possible
to the coupling-joint, without any packing. In riveted
hose, a piece of leather, thinned down to the proper size,
should be put on to make up the void which the thick edge
of the leather next the rivet necessarily leaves; the hose
should then be tied to the coupling-joint as firmly as possible
with the best annealed copper wire, No. 16 gauge.</p>

<p>When the hose are completely finished in this manner
they are proved by a proving-pump, and if they stand a
pressure of two hundred feet of water they are considered
fit for service. I may also add, that when any piece of
hose has been under repair it is proved in the same manner
before it is deemed trustworthy.</p>

<p>The proving of the hose is of very considerable importance,
and the method of doing so which I have mentioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
is greatly superior to the old plan of proving them on an
engine or fire-cock. By the latter method, no certain measure
can be obtained by which the pressure can be calculated.
In the first place it must depend on the relative height of
the reservoir from whence the water is obtained and that of
the fire-cock where the experiment is made; and as the
supply of water drawn from the pipes by the inhabitants
may be different on different days of the week and even in
different hours of the day, it is quite evident that by this
method no certain rule can be formed for the purpose required,
the pressure being affected by the quantity of water
drawn at the time.</p>

<p>The method of proving by an engine is considerably better
than this; but when a proving-pump can be obtained it is
infinitely better than either. One disadvantage of an engine
is, that it requires a considerable number of men; but even
the proof, that of throwing the water to a given height on
the gable of a house or other height, is not always a test of
the sufficiency of the hose. As the temperature is low or
high, the wind fresh or light, the degree of pressure on the
hose in throwing the water to the required height will be
greater or less. Indeed, in high winds it is a matter of extreme
difficulty to throw the water to any considerable
height.</p>

<p>With an engine of 7-inch barrels and 7-inch stroke, fitted
with eighty feet of 2-3/8-inch hose, I have found from several
experiments that when the water is thrown seventy-five feet
high, the pressure on the hose is equal to one hundred feet.
The same engine, with 160 feet of hose, and the branch-pipe
raised fifty feet above the level of the engine, when the water
was thrown fifty-six feet from the branch, occasioned a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
pressure equal to 130 feet on the hose. From these experiments,
I am convinced that the pressure will not be equal
to 200 feet, except in very extreme cases, or when some
obstacle gets into the jet pipe.</p>

<p>I tried the extreme strength of a piece of riveted hose
4 feet long and 2-3/8 inches diameter, and found that it did
not burst till the pressure increased to 500 feet; and when
it gave way the leather was fairly torn along the rivet-holes.</p>

<p>Every possible care should be taken to keep the hose soft
and pliable, and to prevent its being affected by mildew.
After being used, in order to dry them equally they should
be hung up by the centre, with the two ends hanging down,
until half dry. They should then be taken down and
rubbed over with a composition of bees'-wax, tallow, and
neats-foot oil,<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> and again hung up to allow the grease to sink
into the leather. When the hose appear to be dry they should
be a second time rubbed with the composition, and then
coiled up for use. In order that the hose undergoing the
operation of greasing may not be disturbed or used till in a
fit state, it is better to have a double set, and in this way,
while one set is in grease the other is in the engine ready
and fit for service. More time can also be taken for any
repairs which may be necessary, and they will in consequence
be more carefully done, and at fires where a great
length of hose is required the spare set will always be
available. When the weather is damp, and the hose cannot
be dried so as to be fit for greasing in two or three days, a
stove should be put into the room in order to facilitate the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
process. The greatest care, however, must be taken in the
use of artificial heat. The whole apartment should be kept
of one equal temperature, which ought never to be higher
than is requisite to dry the hose for greasing in about forty
hours.</p>

<p><i>Coupling-joints.</i><a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a>&mdash;So much of the efficiency and duration
of the hose depend on the proper form given to the brass
coupling-joints, that I deem it useful to give a detailed
description, both of those generally made use of and of those
adopted by the Edinburgh fire-establishment, and also to
point out their various defects and advantages.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="fig_3" id="fig_3"></a>
<img src="images/image140.png" width="600" height="350" alt="Fig. 3. Old Coupling" title="Fig. 3. Old Coupling" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 3. Old Coupling</span>
</p>

<p>Fig. 3 is the construction commonly made by engine-makers.
Its defects are as follows:&mdash;From the form of the
furrows and ridges where the leather is tied it does not hold
on well against a force tending to pull the hose off end-ways;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
screw-nails are therefore often employed, as at A, to
secure the hose on the brass. The points of these nails
always protrude more or less into the inside of the joint,
and materially impede the current of water. The mouths
of the joints are also turned outwards, and form a shoulder,
as at B. The intention of this is probably to assist in
securing the leather in its place, and to prevent the lapping
from slipping. The effects of it are as follows:&mdash;First, from
the leather being strained over this projection, it becomes
liable to be cut by every accidental injury, and very soon
cracks and gives way, when a portion must be cut off and a
fresh fixing made; second, the leather being stretched over
the projection, does not fit the other part of the joint, and
must be loose or filled up with pieces of leather, or, as is
sometimes done, with brown paper; third, the irregularity
of the calibre of the conduit which this shoulder occasions
diminishes the performance of the engine.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="fig_4" id="fig_4"></a>
<img src="images/image141.png" width="600" height="303" alt="Fig. 4. New Coupling" title="Fig. 4. New Coupling" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 4. New Coupling</span>
</p>

<p>Fig. 4 is the coupling-joint adopted in Edinburgh. The
furrows at the tying place are shallow, but their edges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
present a powerful obstacle to the slipping of the leather.
No screw-nails are employed, nor is there any shoulder, as at
B; there is therefore no impediment to or variation in the
velocity of the current, as the calibres of the coupling joints
and of the hose are so nearly uniform. It will be seen also
that as the lapping projects above the leather this latter can
never be injured by falls or rubbing on the ground.</p>

<p>Another great advantage attending the joints used here
is the manner in which their screws are finished. On
examining the figure minutely, it will be observed that the
male-screw ends in a cylinder of the diameter of the <i>bottom</i>
of its thread, consequently of the diameter of the top of the
thread of the female-screw. The effect of this is, that, when
the screws are brought together, the cylindric portion serves
as a guide to the threads, and the most inexperienced person
cannot fail to make them catch fair at the first trial. The
advantage of this in the circumstances attending fires is
obvious.</p>

<p>These joints, although requiring three or four turns to
close them up, yet as it is only the ring D which requires to
be turned, it can easily be done with the hand alone without
the use of wrenches. Although, when the whole length of
hose has been jointed, it may be as well to send a man with
a pair of wrenches to set the joints firm; this, however, is
by no means absolutely necessary; if the joints are kept
in proper order a man can secure them sufficiently with
the hand.</p>

<p>There is also a facility in taking turns out of the hose,
which no other but a swivel joint affords. By slackening a
single turn any twist may be taken out, without undoing
the joint or stopping the engine, while, from the number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
turns required to close the joints, there is no chance of the
screw being by any accident undone. In order to prevent
the threads from being easily damaged, they should be of a
pretty large size, not more than five or six to the inch. For
the same reason also the thread should be a little rounded.</p>

<p>As it sometimes happens that the screws are damaged by
falling on the street, or by heavy bodies striking them,
whenever the hose have been used the joints should be tried
by a steel gauge-screw, to be kept for that purpose. This
ought to be particularly attended to, as, on arriving at a
fire, it is rather an awkward time to discover that a joint
has been damaged, while the delay thus occasioned may be
attended with very serious consequences.</p>

<p><i>Four Bundles of Sheepskin and Lay-cord.</i>&mdash;These are simply
four or five stripes of sheepskin, each about three or four
inches broad. When a leak occurs in a length of hose
which cannot be easily replaced at the time, one or more
pieces of sheepskin are wrapt tightly over the leak and tied
firmly with a piece of cord. This is but an indifferent
method of mending, but I do not know of any other which
can be so readily applied with the same effect. If another
length of hose can be substituted for the leaky one it is
better to do so; but that is not always at hand, nor does it
always happen that time can be spared for the purpose.</p>

<p><i>Four Lengths of Suction-pipe.</i>&mdash;These are generally made
of leather, riveted tightly over a spiral worm of hoop-iron,
about three-quarters of an inch broad, a piece of tarred
canvas being placed between the worm and the leather.
They are usually made from six to eight feet long, with a
copper strainer screwed on the farther end, to prevent as
much as possible any mud or dirt from getting into the engine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
with the water. It is of advantage to carry four lengths of
suction-pipe, as they can be joined to reach the water; if
one is damaged the others will still be serviceable.</p>

<p>The suction-pipes are more troublesome to rivet than the
common hose, and are done in the following manner:&mdash;After
the joints are fixed on the spiral worm, and it is
covered with the tarred canvas, an iron mandrel longer than
the worm is put through it, the edge being rounded to the
circle of the inside of the worm. The projecting ends of the
mandrel are supported to allow the worm to lie quite clear.
One end of the mandrel has a check, that the brass joint
may not prevent the worm from lying flat on the mandrel.
The leather is then put over the worm, and the rivets being
put into one side, a small thin mandrel is laid over the
canvas and the rivets struck down upon it. If the small
mandrel be not used the heads of the rivets are apt to lie
unequally on the worm.</p>

<p><i>Three Wrenches for Coupling-joints.</i>&mdash;These are for tightening
the coupling-joints, when that cannot be sufficiently
done by hand. When the hose are all put together a man
is sent along the whole line with a pair of wrenches to
tighten such of the coupling-joints as require it. The
wrenches are generally made with a hole to fit the knob on
the coupling-joint, and, when used, are placed, one on the
nob of the male and another on the nob of the female-screw,
so as to pull them in opposite directions.</p>

<p><i>Two Branch Pipes.</i>&mdash;These are taper copper tubes, having
a female-screw at one end to fit the coupling-joints of the
hose, and a male-screw at the other to receive the jet pipes,
one is 4 feet long to use from the outside of a house on fire,
the other 12 inches for inside work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Three Jet-pipes</i> or nozzles of various sizes made to screw
on the end of the branch pipe.</p>

<p>A great many different shapes of jet have been tried, and
that shown in Fig. 5, I found to answer best when tried
with other forms. The old jet was a continuation in a
straight line of the taper of the branch, from the size of the
hose-screw, to the end of the jet-pipe; this had many inconveniences;
the size of the jet could not be increased
without making the jet-pipe nearly parallel. As the
branches were sometimes 7 feet or 8 feet long, in some
instances the orifice at the end of the jet-pipe was larger
than that at the end of the branch. The present form of
the jet completely obviates this difficulty, as the end of the
branch is always 1-1/2 inches diameter.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="fig_5" id="fig_5"></a>
<img src="images/image145.png" width="600" height="208" alt="Fig. 5." title="Fig. 5." />
<span class="caption">Fig. 5.</span>
</p>

<p>The curve of the nozzle of the present jet is determined
by its own size; five times one-half of the difference between
the jet to be made and the end of the branch, is set up on
each side of the diameter of the upper end of the branch, a
straight line is then drawn across, and an arc of a circle
described on this line, from the extremity of each end of
the diameter of the jet, until it meets the top of the branch;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the jet is then continued parallel, the length of its own
diameter; the metal is continued one-eighth of an inch
above this, to allow of a hollow being turned out to protect
the edge: The rule for determining the size of the jet for
inside work is, to "make the diameter of the jet one-eighth
of an inch for every inch in the diameter of the cylinder,
for each 8 inches of stroke." The branch used in this case
is the same size as shown in Fig. 5. When it is necessary
to throw the water to a greater height, or distance, a jet
one-seventh less in area is used, with a branch from 4 feet to
5 feet long.</p>

<p><i>Two Lengths of Scaling Ladders.</i>&mdash;These are 6-1/2 feet long,
and are fitted with sockets so that any number up to 7 or
8 may be joined together to form one ladder varying in
length according to circumstances from 6-1/2 to upwards of
40 feet.</p>

<p><i>One Fire-hook.</i>&mdash;This is similar to a common boat-hook,
of such length as may be most convenient to strap on the
handles of the engine. It is used for pulling down ceilings,
and taking out deafening-boards when the fire happens to
be between the ceiling and the floor above. It is
also used when a strong door is to be broken open.
It is placed with the point upon the door, one or two
men bearing upon it, while another striking the door, the
whole force of the blows is made to fall upon the lock
or other fastening, which generally yields without much
difficulty.</p>

<p><i>Sixty Feet of Patent Line and Twenty Feet of Trace
Line.</i>&mdash;These are generally used for hoisting the hose into
the windows of the house, in which there is a fire, the stairs
being sometimes so crowded with people and furniture, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
it is difficult to force a passage, and when the pipe is laid
in the stair, it is liable to be damaged by people treading
on it.</p>

<p><i>One Mattock and Shovel.</i>&mdash;These are useful in damming
any running water or gutter, uncovering drains, &amp;c., from
which the engine may be supplied with water. The mattock
should be short and strong, and the shovel of the sort called
diamond-pointed.</p>

<p><i>One Hatchet.</i>&mdash;The most serviceable hatchet for a fire-engine,
is similar to that used as a felling axe by wood-cutters.
The back part is made large that it may be conveniently
used as a hammer.</p>

<p><i>One Saw.</i>&mdash;This should be a stout cross-cut saw, very
widely set. It is useful in cutting off the communication
between one house and another, which, when water is scarce,
is sometimes necessary.</p>

<p><i>One Iron Crow-bar.</i>&mdash;This should be about two feet
long. It is used in opening doors, breaking through
walls, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>One Portable Cistern.</i><a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a>&mdash;This is made of canvas on a folding
iron frame, and is used in London placed over the street-fire
plugs, a hole is left in the bottom through which the
water enters and fills the cistern, the escape between the
canvas and the plug box being trifling. Two and sometimes
three engines are worked by suction-pipe from one plug in
this manner. The portable cistern is also used when the
engine is supplied by suction, from water conveyed in carts
or buckets, and is greatly preferable to any plan of emptying
the water directly into the engine. By this latter method<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
there is always a considerable waste of water, arising both from
the height of the engine, and the working of the handles;
and, in addition to these objections only one person can pour
in water at a time. When the water is poured into the
engine from carts, it must stop working till the cart is
emptied. All these objections, are in a great measure removed
by placing the portable cistern clear of the engine;
when used in this manner there must of course be no hole
in the bottom.</p>

<p><i>One Flat Suction Strainer</i>, made to screw on to the suction
pipe, to prevent anything being drawn in that would not
pass through the jet-pipe, and made flat, with no holes in the
upper surface, for use in the portable cistern.</p>

<p><i>One Standcock</i>, with stem to insert direct in the fire-plug,
and used principally with hose to throw a jet for cooling
ruins.</p>

<p><i>One Canvas Sheet.</i>&mdash;This, when stretched out and held
securely by several men, may be jumped into from the
window of a house on fire with comparative safety.</p>

<p><i>One Hand-pump</i>, as described at page <a href="#Page_130">130</a>, and used with
the canvas buckets.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<h3>FIRE ANNIHILATOR</h3>

<p>With regard to the Fire Annihilator, I have seen several
experiments with this machine, and heard of more which
were not successful; and if an invention fails when experiments
are tried, it is open to the impression that it might
fail when brought into active operation. There have also
been many cases where these machines have met with accidents,
one at Drury Lane Theatre amongst the number.</p>

<p>Water, properly applied, will do whatever the Annihilator
can accomplish, and also many things which the latter cannot
do. As it is, there are some forty or fifty different articles
to carry with each fire-engine, and to add to them such unwieldy
things as Fire Annihilators, would be to encumber
the men more than they are at present, with a very doubtful
prospect of advantage.</p>



<h3><a name="WATER_SUPPLY" id="WATER_SUPPLY"></a>WATER SUPPLY.</h3>

<p>The supply of water is the most vital part of any exertions
towards extinguishing fire. Where the pressure is
sufficient, and the mains large enough, by far the most
efficient and economical mode of using the water is to attach
the hose directly to the mains.</p>

<p>In London, however, this can rarely be done, for several
reasons. The greatest number of plugs are on the service
pipes, that is, the pipes for supplying water for domestic
and other purposes, which are only open a short time
every day. If the cisterns are nearly empty, the pressure
cannot be obtained till they are filled. Then, again, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
plugs being some distance apart, it is difficult to obtain
a sufficient number of jets. But when the plugs are full
open 1-3/4 diameter, a sufficient quantity of water is obtained
from each to supply three engines, each of which
will give a jet equal to the plug if confined to one jet.
The pressure also in the mains in London seldom exceeds
120 feet at the utmost. For these reasons the pressure
from the mains is seldom used till the fire is checked,
when the ruins are cooled by the "dummies," as the jets
from the mains are named by the firemen.</p>

<p>If water can be obtained at an elevation, pipes with
plugs or firecocks on them, are preferable to any other
mode at present in use for the supply of fire-engines.
The size of the pipes will depend on the distance and
elevation of the head, and also on the size of the buildings
to be protected. It may be assumed as a general rule,
that the intensity of a fire depends, in a great measure,
on the cubic content of the building; distinction being
made as to the nature and contents of such building. If
no natural elevation of water can be made available, and
the premises are of much value, it may be found advisable
to erect elevated tanks; where this is done, the
quantity of water to be kept ready, and the rate at which
it is delivered, must depend on the means possessed of
making use of the water.</p>

<p>The average size of fire-engines may be taken at two
cylinders of 7 inches diameter, with a length of stroke of
8 inches, making forty strokes each per minute. This sized
engine will throw 141 tons of water in six hours, and
allowing one-fourth for waste, 176 tons would be a fair
provision in the tanks for six hours' work; this quantity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
multiplied by the number of engines within reach, will give
an idea of what is likely to be required at a large fire. If,
however, there are steam-engines to keep up the supply
through the mains, the quantity of water kept in readiness
may be reduced to two hours' consumption, as it is likely
that the steam-engines would be at work before that
quantity was exhausted. This is what may be supposed to
be required, in cases of serious fires in dockyards, in large
stacks of warehouses, or in large manufactories.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">
<a name="fig_6" id="fig_6"></a>
<img src="images/image151.jpg" width="404" height="500" alt="Fig 6. Opening for Suction-pipe." title="Fig 6. Opening for Suction-pipe." />
<span class="caption">Fig 6. Opening for Suction-pipe.</span>
</p>

<p>Where water can be had at nearly the level of the premises,
such as from rivers, canals, &amp;c., if it is not thought
prudent to erect elevated tanks, the water may be conducted
under the surface by large cast-iron pipes, with openings at
such distances as may seem advisable for introducing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
suction-pipes (Fig. 6). This plan should not be adopted
where the level of the water is more than 12 feet below the
surface of the ground, as although a fire-engine will, if perfectly
tight, draw from a much greater depth than 14 feet
(2 feet being allowed for the height of the engine), still a
very trifling leakage will render it useless for the time, at
such a depth.</p>

<p>The worst mode of supplying engines with water is by
covered sunk tanks; they are generally too small, and unless
very numerous, confine the engines to one or two particular
spots, obliging the firemen to increase the length of the hose
which materially diminishes the effect of the fire-engine. If
the tank is supplied by mains from a reservoir, it would be
much better to save the expense of the tank, and to place
plugs or firecocks on the water-pipe. Another evil in sunk
tanks is, that the firemen can seldom guess what quantity
of water they may depend upon, and they may thus be
induced to attempt to stop a fire, at a point they would not
have thought of if they had known correctly the quantity
of water in store.</p>

<p>Where sunk tanks are already constructed, they may be
rendered more available by a partial use of the method shown
in Fig. 6.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Memoranda of Experiments tried on the mains and service
pipes of the Southwark Water Company, between 4 and 9</i>
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span> <i>of the 31st January, 1844. The wind blowing fresh

<p>The pressure at the water-works at Battersea was kept at
120 feet during the experiments, and every service pipe or
other outlet was kept shut.</p>

<p><i>1st Experiment.</i>&mdash;Six standcocks, with one length of 2-1/2
inches riveted leather hose 40 feet long, and one copper
branch 4 feet to 5 feet long, with a jet 7/8 inch in diameter on
each, were placed in six plugs on a main 7 inches diameter,
in Union-street, between High-Street, Borough, and Gravel-lane,
Southwark, at distances of about 120 yards apart. The

jet were taken off with one length of hose the delivery was
260 gallons per minute.</p>

<p>2nd. The second standcock was then opened, and the jet
from the first was 45 feet high.</p>

<p>3rd. The third standcock was opened, and the jet from the
first 40 feet high.</p>

<p>4th. The fourth standcock being opened, the first gave a
jet of 35 feet high.</p>

<p>5th. The fifth being opened, the first gave a jet of 30 feet
high.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>6th. All the six being opened, the first gave a jet of 27
feet in height.</p>

<p><i>2nd Experiment.</i>&mdash;Six standcocks were then put into
plugs, on a main 9 inches diameter in Tooley-Street, the
extreme distance being 450 yards, with hose and jets as in
the first experiment. The water was brought from the head
at Battersea by 4250 yards of iron pipes of 20 inches
diameter, 1000 yards of 15 inches diameter, 1400 yards of 9
inches diameter. The weather was nearly the same, but the
place of experiment was more protected from the wind than
in Union-street.</p>

<p>1st. With one standcock open, a jet 60 feet in height
was produced, and 107 gallons per minute were delivered.</p>

<p>2nd. The second standcock was then opened, and the
difference in the first jet was barely perceptible.</p>

<p>3rd. Other two standcocks being opened, the first jet was
reduced to 45 feet in height, and the delivery to 92 gallons
per minute.</p>

<p>4th. All the six standcocks being opened, the first jet was
further reduced to 40 feet high, and the delivery to 76 gallons
per minute.</p>

<p><i>3rd Experiment.</i>&mdash;Two standcocks, with hose, &amp;c., as in
the first experiment, were then put into a service-pipe, 4
inches diameter and 200 yards long, in Tooley-street, the
service-pipe was connected with 200 yards of main 5 inches
diameter, branching from the main of 9 inches diameter.
The weather was still the same as at first, but the wind did
not appear to affect the jets, owing to the buildings all round
being so much higher than the jet.</p>

<p>1st. The standcock nearest the larger main was opened,
and a jet of 40 feet high was produced, delivering 82 gallons
per minute.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>2nd. Both standcocks being opened, the first gave a jet
of 31 feet, and delivered 68 gallons per minute.</p>

<p>3rd. The standcock farthest from the large main only
being opened, gave a jet of 34 feet, and delivered 74 gallons
per minute.</p>

<p>4th. Both standcocks being opened, the farthest one gave
a jet of 23 feet, and delivered 58 gallons per minute.</p>

<p>When both these plugs were allowed to flow freely without
hose, the water from that nearest the large main, rose
about 18 inches, and the farther one about 1 inch above
the plug-box.</p>

<p>These and other experiments prove the necessity of
placing the plugs on the mains, and not on the service pipes,
where there are mains in the street.</p>

<p>The different modes of obtaining water from the mains or
pipes are shown in the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p>(Fig. 8) is a section of the common plug, with a canvas
dam or cistern over it, as used in London. The cistern is
made of No. 1 canvas, 15 inches deep, extended at top and
bottom by 5/8-inch round iron frames, a double stay is hinged
on the top frame at each end. When the cistern is used
the top frame is lifted up, and the stays put into the notches,
in two pieces of hoop iron, fixed to the bottom frame.
There is a circular opening 9 inches diameter in the canvas
bottom, two circular rings of wash-leather, about 2 inches
broad, are attached to the edges of the opening in the canvas,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
so as to contract it to 4 inches or 5 inches diameter; the
plug being opened, the cistern is placed over it; the wash-leather
is pressed down to the surface of the road by the
water, and a tolerably water-tight cistern, with about 12
inches or 14 inches of water in it, is immediately obtained.</p>

<p>It will be observed, that the short piece of pipe between
the main and this firecock is not curved to the
current of the water, but merely opened a little; this is
done with a view of increasing the supply by steam power,
and as the steam engines are, in most cases, situated in a
different direction from the tanks or reservoirs, therefore
the curve that would have assisted the current in one
direction would have retarded it in the other. It has been
objected to these firecocks, that the opening does not run
through the centre of the key, therefore only one side of the
key covers the opening in the barrel, while in the common
firecock both sides are covered.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 12. Double Firecock, used at the British Museum.</span>
</p>

<p>(Fig. 12) is a double firecock, as laid down at the British
Museum.</p>

<p>This has a very good delivery, and is certain to be always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
tight, if well made, as the pressure of the water forces the
key into the barrel; this also renders the cock somewhat
difficult to be opened and shut, if the pressure be great; but
as a lever of any length may be used, and the key, from its
perpendicular position, may be loosened by a blow, this objection
is in a great measure obviated.</p>

<p>In Figs. 10 and 11 the openings in the street are large
enough to admit of the levers for opening the cock to be
fixed, that no mistake may occur from the lever being mislaid;
but with those at the British Museum, it was not
thought necessary to have fixed levers, as a crow-bar, or
anything that could be introduced into the eye of the
spanner, would open them.</p>

<p>The plug and firecock have both certain advantages and
disadvantages, which are now described.</p>

<p>The plug, with a canvas cistern, is the easiest mode of
obtaining water; the plug-box being only the size of a paving-stone,
is no annoyance in the street, and the water has
only one angle to turn before it is delivered.</p>

<p>On the other hand, where the supply of water is limited,
the plugs give but little command of it; there is, however,
comparatively very small loss at a large fire in London from
this cause, as it is very seldom that all the fire-engines can
be supplied direct from the plugs, and those that arrive late
must pick up the waste water as they best can, by using
another description of canvas dam, or opening the street;
but in enclosed premises, especially where the water is kept
for the purpose of extinguishing fires, firecocks are much
to be preferred. It is very difficult to insert the standcock
into a plug if there is a considerable force of water, and if
the paving has moved, it cannot be done without raising the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
plug-box; but this is, however, the easiest mode of using
firecocks, and where there is a considerable pressure of
water, if the watchmen or the police are supplied with a
hose-reel and branch-pipe, they can, in enclosed premises,
direct a jet on the fire while the engines are being prepared,
and if they cannot reach the fire, they will have water
ready for the engine when it arrives.</p>

<p>Inclosed premises are particularly mentioned, because the
principal duty of the watchmen, in these cases, is to guard
against fire, and their other duties being comparatively few,
the men are not often changed, and they can be instructed
thoroughly in the matter. With the general police of the
metropolis it is quite different, their duties are so numerous
and varied, that to add that of firemen to them would only
be to confuse them.</p>

<p>Firecocks, if kept at 9 inches to 12 inches below the surface,
are easily protected from frost, by stuffing the opening
with straw.</p>

<p>The advantage which the double firecocks have over the
single ones, is merely the increased water-way, as a firecock
3-1/2 inches diameter could not be so easily opened or shut, as
two cocks of 2-1/2 inches diameter.</p>

<p>One of the greatest objections to firecocks, is the very
large openings required in the streets, the first cost and the
repair of which are both considerable, besides their liability
to accident. To take them to the footpath, increases the
expenses and diminishes the supply of water, as it is generally
done with a small pipe, and the number of angles is increased.
In some instances, where firecocks have been put
down on one side of the street, no less than four right angles
have been made in the course of the water; and if the fire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
happens to be on the opposite side of the street from the
firecock, the thoroughfare must be stopped. The expense
also is no slight consideration, for if laid along with the
water-pipes, each firecock, if properly laid, and the pit built
round with cement, will cost eight or ten times as much as a
plug.</p>

<p>London is, upon the whole (except in the warehouse districts),
fairly supplied with water for the average description
of fires, that is, where not more than five or six engines are
required. When, however, it is necessary to work ten or
twelve engines, there is very often a deficiency. In many of
the warehouse districts the supply is very limited indeed,
although it is there that the largest fires take place.</p>

<p>The water companies are generally willing to give any
quantity of water, but they object to lay down large mains
without any prospect of remuneration. The warehouse
keepers decline to be at the expense of laying the pipes, and
there the matter seems to rest. In most other places of importance,
the water is under the management of the civic
authorities, and they, of course, endeavour to obtain a good
supply of water at fires in warehouse as well as in other
districts.</p>

<p>In supplying fire-engines with water from firecocks, one
or more lengths of hose are screwed on the firecock; the
extreme end being put into the engine, the firecock is then
opened and the water rushes in. When the water-pipes are
large and the pressure considerable, two or even three engines
may be supplied from the same firecock.</p>

<p>If the firecocks are all at too great a distance from the
place on fire, to be reached by the supply of hose brought
with the engine, the next resource is, to open the nearest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
firecock above the level of the place where the water is required.
By covering the eyes of drains, and stopping up
any cross-water channels, the water may in this manner be
conveyed along the street, from a very considerable distance.
From the nature of the ground it does not always happen
that the water will run directly from the nearest firecock,
to the spot where it is required; acclivities, buildings, and
many other causes, may prevent this; but in some of these
cases a few lengths of the hose, attached to the firecock,
may convey the water to a channel which will conduct it to
the required point. Upon the arrival of the water, it ought
to be dammed up, and the engine will lift it by suction out
of the pool so formed.</p>

<p>If, however, from the nature of the ground, from the
want of hose, or from other causes, it is found impracticable
to convey the water by either of the above methods, the
next best is, to conduct the water in hose as far as can be
accomplished, and carry it the remainder of the distance in
carts, buckets, or whatever else may be most convenient.</p>

<p>When carried in buckets it is of advantage to form a line
of men from the water to the engine, each man covering five
or six feet of ground. The buckets are then handed from
one man to another, till they reach the two or three men
who are stationed round the suction-tub or fire-engine to receive
them. The buckets when emptied are returned by a
different line of men (women or boys) stationed in the same
manner as the former. If a sufficient number of hands
cannot be had to return the buckets in this manner, any
convenient number may be employed to carry them to the
firecock, that they may be again filled. When a fire occurs
where the water-pipes are unprovided with firecocks or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
plugs, the ground should be immediately opened, and the
water-pipe cut. If it be of cast-iron, a large hammer may
effect the purpose: on the water-pipe being broken, the
suction-pipe of the engine is placed in the opening so made.
If the pipe be of lead, the opening in the street should be
made of sufficient length to admit of one end of it, when
cut, being turned into the engine. If the supply of water
by this means be so great as to occasion waste, it may be regulated
by the nearest stopcock on the water-pipe, by driving
a wooden plug into the end of a cast-iron pipe, or
compressing the end of a leaden one.</p>

<p>The next plan I shall notice of supplying fire-engines is
from drains, gutters, &amp;c. In particular situations and wet
weather considerable supplies of water from these and
similar sources may be obtained. In the gutters all that is
required is to dam them up; and, if there be no materials
at hand for this purpose, the causeway must be dug up, till
there is a sufficient depth of water for the suction-pipe of
the engine.</p>

<p>When the water is to be drawn from drains or common
sewers, great care should be taken not to damage them
farther than is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>If enough of cover be taken off to allow one man to
enter easily, it will be quite sufficient for all necessary purposes.
When the man inside the drain or common sewer
has collected a proper supply of water by damming up the
channel, the suction-pipe should be handed down to him,
and the engine set to work.</p>

<p>Although it be true that foul water quenches fire, I will
here observe, that the water from a common sewer should
never be used, except when it is impossible to procure it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
from a purer source. For the purpose of procuring water to
extinguish a fire, I had at one time occasion to open a common
sewer, in which, with the usual impurities, the waste
from a gas manufactory was intermixed, and the stench in
the premises where the fire had been extinguished by this
water, was for some time after very disagreeable.</p>

<p>If the water be obtained from a pond or river at a little
distance, one engine may be stationed close to it, and that
engine made to pump the water into another at work. If
the water be conveyed in carts, an engine may be kept at
the pond or river for the purpose of filling them. Of course
this can only be done where there is a proper supply of
engines.</p>

<p>In working from an open water, such as a gutter, drain,
river, or pond, it is proper, in order to prevent sand or
gravel being drawn into the engine, to sink an iron or
wooden bucket, into which the suction-pipe of the engine
should be placed. If nothing better can be had, a good
wicker basket will be found useful.</p>

<p>It is of great advantage to have a number of carts, with
butts upon them full of water, as it ensures a small supply
to the engines the moment they arrive at the fire. This
plan, however, entails a very considerable expense, as carters
must be paid for taking them out on every alarm, besides
giving prizes to the owners of the first and second horses, to
ensure their coming in time.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>


<p>The following, on Steam Fire-engines and the Metropolitan
Fire Brigade, is added as a supplement to Mr.
Braidwood's account of the London Fire Brigade, and brings
the information upon these subjects up to the present date
(May, 1866):&mdash;</p>

<p>The steam fire-engine was first constructed in London, in
1830, before the formation of the London Fire Brigade, by
Braithwaite, who made several engines, and exhibited them
at various public trials, also at several fires, but without
being able to bring them into general use.</p>

<p>The matter remained in abeyance till 1852, when the
London Fire Brigade caused their large hand-worked floating
fire-engine to be altered so as to be worked by steam.
This engine having been originally made by Tilley, of
London, the alterations were entrusted to Shand and Mason,
his successors. In the same year the first American steam
fire-engine was constructed in New York.</p>

<p>In 1855 the London Fire Brigade, stimulated by their first
experiment, caused an entirely new self-propelling, floating
steam fire-engine to be constructed. The experience gained
by their first attempt at steam fire-engine making, enabled
Shand and Mason to compete successfully in this matter, as
their design was adopted after receiving the approval of
the late Mr. Walker, Engineer, of Great George Street,
London.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>The re-introduction of land steam fire-engines into London
was accomplished by Shand and Mason, who, in 1858, constructed
their first; this engine, after several public trials,
was in the same year sent to St. Petersburgh.</p>

<p>In 1859 the same firm constructed two land steam fire-engines,
which they offered to the London Fire Brigade for
hire or purchase, and in the following year (1860) the Fire
Brigade took one on hire for one year. This experiment
proved so successful, that in 1861 the committee purchased,
from Shand and Mason, the fourth steam engine of their
construction. This, with one of the two made in 1859, were
the only land steam engines that were at work at the Great
Tooley Street Fire of 1861.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1862, Mr. Lee, of the firm of Lee and
Larned, of New York, brought over a land steam fire-engine
to be placed in the International Exhibition. This
was worked in public at Hodges' Distillery on the
24th of March previous to the opening of the Exhibition.</p>

<p>Shand and Mason supplied the London Fire Brigade in
April, 1862, with the eighth land steam fire-engine of their
construction. Messrs. Merryweather and Sons, of London,
placed their first land steam fire-engine in the International
Exhibition of 1862, but this, like the ninth by Shand and
Mason, was not in time for the opening, and consequently
could not compete for a prize medal, which was awarded to
Lee and Larned, of New York.</p>

<p>A public trial, however, took place before the jury of the
Exhibition, of which the following is an account extracted
verbatim from the jurors' published reports:&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Report of the Special Committee of Class VIII. on Fire-Engines.</span></h4>

<p><i>After detailing the Trials of Hand-worked Fire-Engines, the
Report states that</i>,&mdash;</p>

<p>The Committee next proceeded to take the necessary steps
for trying the steam fire-engines on the 1st of July, and, as
before, invited the engine builders to a preliminary meeting,
that they might receive full information as to the rules and
regulations to be observed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>In compliance with this invitation, the following engine-makers
attended a meeting on the 28th of June, viz:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Lee, of the firm of Lee and Larned, Novelty Iron-works, New York.</p>

<p>Messrs. Merryweather and Son.</p>

<p>Messrs. Shand and Mason.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Lee declined to produce his steam fire-engine for
trial, alleging various reasons for so doing, and though
strongly urged, persisted in his resolution, and declined the
contest.</p>

<p>Messrs. Merryweather and Son expressed themselves
ready to produce their steam fire-engine on the appointed
day.</p>

<p>Messrs. Shand and Mason informed the Committee that
the engine which they had intended to work would not be
ready owing to an accident, but requested permission to
produce for trial two steam-engines made by them for the
London Fire-Engine Establishment, although they were not
in the Exhibition. All the arrangements having been
made for trying several engines together, the Committee
granted this request, as otherwise only one engine would
have been present, and a complete table of results could
therefore not have been obtained.</p>

<p>The Committee assembled in the appointed place at eight
o'clock on the morning of the 1st of July, and found three
engines present, viz., one of Messrs. Merryweather and Son
and two of Messrs. Shand and Mason.</p>

<p>After the Committee had examined the boilers and machinery
generally, the engine-makers filled their respective
boilers with cold water from the river, and fires having been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
laid, the three were lighted at the same moment, and the
makers were ordered to commence working into a tank at
sixty feet distance as soon as they had attained a steam
pressure of 100 lbs. to the square inch.</p>

<p>Messrs. Merryweather's engine attained the pressure
named in 12 minutes 10 seconds, Messrs. Shand and Mason's
large engine in 18 minutes 30 seconds, the small engine in
about 30 minutes, some mismanagement having occurred
which compelled them to draw the fire in the latter and
light it a second time. Messrs. Merryweather's engine commenced
working as arranged when the steam-gauge indicated
a pressure of 100 lbs., and was 2 minutes and 50 seconds at
work before water passed through the nose-pipe. Notwithstanding
this very serious defect, this engine had poured 500
gallons of water into a tank 60 feet distant in 17 minutes
and 15 seconds from the time at which the fire was lighted.
After the difficulty of drawing the water had been surmounted,
this engine worked well, and threw an admirable
jet, losing 15 lbs. steam-pressure during the first trial. After
three trials this engine became disabled; it was, however,
repaired on the ground in about an hour and a half, and resumed
work at the ninth trial, continuing to work well
until the thirteenth, when it became again disabled, and was
withdrawn by the maker, to the great regret of the Committee,
who were thus left to continue the experiments with
only two engines, both made by one firm.</p>

<p>Messrs. Shand and Mason's large engine was 18 minutes
30 seconds getting up steam to 100 lbs., and when started
drew water instantly, losing during the first trial 5 lbs. of
steam-pressure.</p>

<p>This engine was severely tested, and worked without accident<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
throughout the day, the seventeenth trial lasting no
less than 63 minutes, during which the steam and water
were both kept to a pressure of 90 lbs. on the square inch
throughout, working through a 1-3/8 inch nose-pipe.</p>

<p>At the eighteenth and last trial this engine threw a good
vertical jet.</p>

<p>Messrs. Shand and Mason's small engine did not raise the
steam to 100 lbs. in less than 30 minutes, owing, of course,
partly to the mismanagement already mentioned, and partly
to the nature of the boiler and fire-box, which, according to
the makers' account, are not adapted for raising steam in the
shortest possible time. After the engine got to work the
steam-pressure was well sustained, and the engine continued
working the entire day without accident, concluding in the
evening by throwing a good vertical jet.</p>

<p>During the time occupied by the trials the direction of
the wind was W.N.W. to W. by N., pressure 2-1/2 to 4-1/2 lbs.
on the square foot. The barometer stood at 29.97 inches.</p>


<h5><i>Summary.</i></h5>

<p>On the whole the Committee find as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Messrs. Merryweather and Son have produced, at a price
of 700<i>l.</i>, a steam fire-engine, weighing, according to the
makers' account, 65 cwt., with jets and lamps, but without
water, coal, suction-pipes, hose, or other gear, and capable, if
no accidents occur, of throwing in an available stream the
following average quantities of water per minute:&mdash;</p>

<p>Shand and Mason's tenth land steam fire-engine was supplied
to the London Brigade in June, 1862, and their
twelfth, in February, 1863, upon orders given on the 4th
January, 1862. But as the Committee of the London Fire
Brigade were now negotiating with Government to take the
duty of extinguishing fires off their hands, no orders for
steam-engines were given out by them after the above
date.</p>

<h3>STEAM FIRE-ENGINE COMPETITION,</h3>

<h4>CRYSTAL PALACE, LONDON, 1863.</h4>

<p>Towards the close of 1862, several engineers and other
gentlemen interested in the improvement of steam fire-engines,
offered prizes to be awarded at competitive trials to
take place in London. The following is the Committee's
published account of these trials which were held in the
grounds of the Crystal Palace Company on the 1st, 2nd, and
3rd July, 1863.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>The engines were divided into two classes, the large class
consisting of those weighing over 30 cwts., and not exceeding
60 cwts. and the small class of those not exceeding 30 cwts.</p>

<p>The prizes offered were 250<i>l.</i> for the best engine, and 100<i>l</i>.
for the second best, in each class.</p>

<p>The chief points to which the Committee directed their
attention, in addition to the consideration of cost and
weight, were those relating to the general efficiency of the
machines as fire-engines, combining among other points of
excellence&mdash;</p>

<p>From the above trials it was found that the first prize
large-class engine weighed 6504 lbs., and delivered in one
hour 11,366 gallons, being at the rate of 196 gallons for
each hundred-weight of the engine; while the first prize
small-class engine delivered in the same time 8142 gallons,
or 276 for each hundred-weight of the engine, showing that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
the latter engine delivered nearly one-half more water in
proportion to its weight, than was delivered by the large one,
the conditions of the two trials being the same.</p>

<p>As the greatest amount of power in the smallest possible
bulk and weight, was considered most available for use at
London fires, the Committee of the London Fire Brigade,
although not in a position, for the reasons already stated, to
purchase additional steam fire-engines, commenced hiring
Shand, Mason, and Co.'s prize engines, and at the close of
1865 had four such in use in this manner.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Fire Brigade, an extension of the late
London Fire Brigade, has now (May, 1866) the following
steam fire-engines in use:&mdash;The Floating Steam Fire-engine,
by Shand and Mason, in 1855; a Land Steam Fire-engine by
Easton and Amos, which was worked at the Crystal Palace
trials, and is now used in a barge as a floating engine; one
by Roberts, which was also worked at the Crystal Palace;
three by Merryweather and Sons; and fifteen of Shand,
Mason, and Co.'s Land Steam Fire-engines.</p>


<h3>METROPOLITAN FIRE BRIGADE.</h3>

<p>The disastrous results of the great fire at Tooley-street, in
1861, at which Mr. Braidwood lost his life, fully demonstrated
the inadequacy (in men and appliances) of the
fire brigade supported by the insurance offices, and as these
bodies declined extending their establishment so as to meet
the wants of the whole of the metropolis, a Parliamentary
inquiry was instituted, which resulted in the passing of the
following Act:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<h4>ANNO VICESIMO OCTAVO &amp; VICESIMO NONO</h4>

<h3>VICTORI&AElig; REGIN&AElig;.</h3>

<h4>CAP. XC.</h4>

<h4>An Act for the Establishment of a Fire Brigade
within the Metropolis. [5th July, 1865.]</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span> it is expedient to make further provision for the
protection of life and property from fire within the
metropolis: Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent
Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present
Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as
follows:</p>


<h5><i>Preliminary.</i></h5>

<p>1. This Act may be cited for all purposes as the "Metropolitan
Fire Brigade Act, 1865."</p>

<p>2. For the purposes of this Act the "Metropolis" shall
mean the City of <i>London</i> and all other parishes and places
for the time being within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan
Board of Works:</p>

<p>"Insurance Company" shall include any persons corporate
or unincorporate, or any person carrying on the business
of fire insurance.</p>

<p>3. The expression "Metropolis Local Management Acts"
shall mean the Acts following; that is to say, "The Metropolis
Management Act, 1855," "The Metropolis Management<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Amendment Act, 1856," and "The Metropolis
Management Amendment Act, 1862."</p>


<h5><i>Establishment and Duties of Fire Brigade.</i></h5>

<p>4. On and after the first day of <i>January</i> one thousand
eight hundred and sixty-six the duty of extinguishing fires
and protecting life and property in case of fire shall
within the metropolis be deemed for the purposes of this
Act to be entrusted to the Metropolitan Board of Works;
and with a view to the performance of that duty it shall
be lawful for them to provide and maintain an efficient
force of firemen, and to furnish them with all such fire
engines, horses, accoutrements, tools, and implements
as may be necessary for the complete equipment of the
force, or conducive to the efficient performance of their
duties.</p>

<p>5. The said Board, hereinafter referred to as the Board,
may take on lease, purchase, or otherwise acquire stations
for engines, stables, houses for firemen, and such other
houses, buildings, or land as they may think requisite for
carrying into effect the purposes of this Act, and may from
time to time sell any property acquired by or vested in them
for the purposes of this Act:</p>

<p>The Board may also contract with any company or persons
authorized to establish the same for the establishment
of telegraphic communication between the several stations
in which their fire engines or firemen are placed, and
between any of such stations and other parts of the
metropolis.</p>

<p>6. On and after the said first day of January one thousand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
eight hundred and sixty-six, all stations, fire-engines,
fire escapes, plant, and other property belonging to or used
by the fire engine establishment of the insurance companies
in the metropolis shall vest in or be conveyed or
assigned to the Board for all the estate and interest of the
said companies therein, upon trust to be applied by the
Board to the purposes of this Act, but subject to all legal
liabilities and obligations attaching thereto, including the
payment of all pensions that have been granted to the members
of the said Fire Engine Establishment, according to a
list that has been furnished to the chairman of the said
Board by the chief officer of the said fire-engine establishment,
and all trustees for the same shall be indemnified
against such liabilities and obligations. The Board may
also, if they think fit, purchase the stations, fire-engines,
and plant belonging to any parish, place, or body of persons
within their jurisdiction.</p>

<p>7. The force of firemen established under this Act, hereinafter
called the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, shall be under
the command of an officer, to be called the chief officer of
the Metropolitan Fire Brigade.</p>

<p>The chief officer and men composing the said fire
brigade shall be appointed and removed at the pleasure of
the Board.</p>

<p>8. The Board shall pay such salaries as they think expedient
to the said fire brigade. They may also make such
regulations as they think fit with respect to the compensation
to be made to them in case of accident, or to their
wives or families in case of their death; also with respect
to the pensions or allowances to be paid to them in case of
retirement; also with respect to the gratuities to be paid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
to persons giving notices of fires; also with respect to
gratuities by way of a gross sum or annual payment to be
from time to time awarded to any member of the said
force, or to any other person, for extraordinary services
performed in cases of fire; also with respect to gratuities to
turncocks belonging to waterworks from which a supply of
water is quickly derived.</p>

<p>9. The Board may by byelaws make regulations for the
training, discipline, and good conduct of the men belonging
to the said fire brigade, for their speedy attendance with
engines, fire escapes, and all necessary implements on the
occasion of any alarm of fire, and generally for the maintenance
in a due state of efficiency of the said brigade, and
may annex to any breach of such regulations penalties not
exceeding in amount forty shillings, but no byelaw under
this section shall be of any validity unless it is made and
confirmed in manner directed by the Metropolis Local
Management Acts; and all the provisions of the said Acts
relating to byelaws shall, with the necessary variations,
apply to any byelaws made in pursuance of this Act.</p>

<p>10. The vestry of any parish or place in the metropolis
may allow such compensation as they think just to any engine
keeper or other person employed in the service of fire
engines who has hitherto been paid out of any rate raiseable
in such parish or place, and who is deprived of his employment
by or in consequence of the passing of this Act, and
any compensation so allowed shall be paid out of the rate
out of which the salary of the officer so compensated was
payable.</p>

<p>11. The Board may make such arrangements as they
think fit as to establishing fire escapes throughout the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
metropolis. They may for that purpose contribute to the
funds of the Royal Society for the Protection of Life from
Fire, or of any existing society that provides fire escapes,
or may purchase or take by agreement the property of any
existing society in their stations and fire escapes, and
generally may maintain such fire escapes and do such things
as they think expedient towards aiding persons to escape
from fire; and any expenses incurred by them in pursuance
of this section shall be deemed to be expenses incurred
in carrying into effect this Act.</p>

<p>12. On the occasion of a fire, the chief or other officer
in charge of the fire brigade may, in his discretion, take
the command of any volunteer fire brigade or other persons
who voluntarily place their services at his disposal, and may
remove, or order any fireman to remove, any persons who
interfere by their presence with the operations of the fire
brigade, and generally he may take any measures that appear
expedient for the protection of life and property, with
power by himself or his men to break into or through, or
take possession of, or pull down any premises for the purpose
of putting an end to a fire, doing as little damage as possible;
he may also on any such occasion cause the water to be shut
off from the mains and pipes of any district, in order to give
a greater supply and pressure of water in the district in
which the fire has occurred; and no water company shall
be liable to any penalty or claim by reason of any interruption
of the supply of water occasioned only by compliance
with the provisions of this section.</p>

<p>All police constables shall be authorized to aid the fire
brigade in the execution of their duties. They may close
any street in or near which a fire is burning, and they may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
of their own motion, or on the request of the chief or other
officer of the fire brigade, remove any persons who interfere
by their presence with the operations of the fire brigade.</p>

<p>Any damage occasioned by the fire brigade in the due
execution of their duties shall be deemed to be damage by
fire within the meaning of any policy of insurance against
fire.</p>


<h5><i>Expenses.</i></h5>

<p>13. Every insurance company that insures from fire any
property in the metropolis shall pay annually to the Metropolitan
Board of Works, by way of contribution toward the
expenses of carrying this Act into effect, a sum after the rate
of thirty-five pounds in the one million pounds on the
gross amounts insured by it, except by way of reassurance,
in respect of property in the metropolis for a year, and at a
like rate for any fractional part of a million, and for any
fractional part of a year as well as for any number of years
for which the insurance may be made, renewed, or continued.</p>

<p>The said payments by insurance companies shall be made
quarterly in advance, on the 1st of January, 1st of April,
1st of July, and 1st of October in every year; the first of
such payments to be made on the 1st of January one
thousand eight hundred and sixty-six, and such first payment
and the other payments for the year one thousand eight
hundred and sixty-six to be based upon the amounts insured
by the several companies in respect of property in the
metropolis in the year ending the twenty-fourth of December
one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four: provided
that any insurance company which at the time of the passing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
of this Act contributes to the expenses of the said fire
engine establishment may, in respect of all payments to be
made by it in the years one thousand eight hundred and
sixty-six and one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven,
but not afterwards, contribute after the yearly rate of thirty-five
pounds in one million pounds of the business in
respect of which it contributes to the said fire engine
establishment for the present year, according to a return
which has been furnished to the chairman of the said Metropolitan
Board, instead of in the manner in this Act provided.</p>

<p>14. All contributions due from an insurance company to
the Board in pursuance of this Act shall be deemed to be
specialty debts due from the company to the Board, and be
recovered accordingly.</p>

<p>15. For the purpose of ascertaining the amount to be contributed
by every such insurance company as aforesaid,
every insurance company insuring property from fire in the
metropolis shall, on the thirtieth day of December one
thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, with respect to the
amounts insured in the year one thousand eight hundred
and sixty-four, and on the 1st of June one thousand eight
hundred and sixty-six, and on every succeeding 1st of June,
or on such other days as the Metropolitan Board of Works
may appoint, make a return to the said Board, in such form
as they may require, of the gross amount insured by it in
respect of property in the metropolis.</p>

<p>There shall be annexed to the return so made a declaration
made by the secretary or other officer performing the
duties of secretary of the company by whom it is made,
stating that he has examined the return with the books of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the company, and that to the best of his knowledge, information,
and belief, it contains a true and faithful account of the
gross amount of the sums insured by the company to which
he belongs in respect of property in the metropolis.</p>

<p>The return made in the June of one year shall not come
into effect till the 1st of January of the succeeding year,
and shall be the basis of the contributions for that year.</p>

<p>16. If any insurance company makes default in making
such returns to the Board as are required by this Act, it shall
be liable to a penalty not exceeding five pounds for every
day during which it is so in default.</p>

<p>17. The secretary or other officer having the custody of
the books and papers of any insurance company that is
required to pay a contribution to the Board in pursuance of
this Act shall allow any officer appointed by the Board to
inspect, during the hours of business, any books and papers
that will enable him to ascertain the amount of property
insured by such company in the metropolis, and the amount
for which it is insured, and to make extracts from such books
or papers; and any secretary or other such officer as aforesaid
of a company failing to comply with the requisitions of
this section in respect of such inspections and extracts shall
be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding
five pounds for each offence.</p>

<p>18. The Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury shall
pay or cause to be paid to the Board by way of contribution
to the expenses of maintaining the fire brigade such sums
as Parliament may from time to time grant for that purpose,
not exceeding in any one year the sum of ten thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>19. For the purpose of defraying all expenses that may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
be incurred by the Board in carrying into effect this Act
which are not otherwise provided for, the Board may from
time to time issue their precepts to the overseers of the
poor of every parish or place within the metropolis, requiring
the overseers to pay over the amount mentioned in the
precepts to the Treasurer of the Board, or into a bank to be
named in the precepts, within forty days from the delivery of
the precept.</p>

<p>The overseers shall comply with the requisitions of any
such precept by paying the sums mentioned out of any
monies in their hands applicable to the relief of the poor, or
by levying the amount required as part of the rate for the
relief of the poor, but no contribution required to be paid
by any parish or place under this section shall exceed in the
whole in any one year the rate of one halfpenny in the
pound on the full and fair annual value of property rateable
to the relief of the poor within the said parish or place, such
full and fair annual value to be computed in all parts of the
metropolis, exclusive of the city of London, according to the
last valuation for the time being acted on in assessing the
county rate, or, where there is no county rate, according to a
like estimate or basis; and no liberty, precinct, or place,
shall be exempt from the rate leviable for the purposes of
this Act by reason of its being extra-parochial or otherwise;
and in default of proper officers in any liberty, precinct, or
place, to assess or levy the said rate, the Board may appoint
such officers, and add the amount of any expenses so incurred
to the amount to be raised by the next succeeding rate in
such liberty, precinct, or place.</p>

<p>Overseers shall, for the purposes of levying any amount
required to be levied by them under this Act, have the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
powers and be subject to the same obligations as in levying
a rate for the relief of the poor.</p>

<p>The word "Overseers" shall include any persons or bodies
of persons authorized or required to make and collect or
cause to be collected rates applicable to the relief of the
poor; and such persons or bodies shall pay to the Board the
amount so mentioned in the precept out of the said rates.</p>

<p>20. In case the amount ordered by any such precept as
aforesaid to be paid by the overseers of any parish or place
be not paid in manner directed by such precept and within
the time therein specified for that purpose, it shall be lawful
for any justice of the peace, upon the complaint by the
Board or by any person authorized by the Board, to issue his
warrant for levying the amount or so much thereof as may
be in arrear by distress and sale of the goods of all or any
of the said overseers, and in case the goods of all the overseers
be not sufficient to pay the same, the arrears thereof
shall be added to the amount of the next levy which is
directed to be made in such parish or place for the purposes
of this Act, and shall be collected by the like methods.</p>

<p>21. The Board may, with the consent of the Commissioners
of Her Majesty's Treasury, borrow any sum not exceeding
forty thousand pounds, and apply the same for the purposes
of this Act; and all powers contained in the Metropolis
Local Management Acts authorizing the Board to borrow
money, or any commissioners or persons to lend money to
the Board, and all other provisions as to the mode of borrowing,
the repayment of principal or interest, or in anywise
relating to borrowing by the Board, shall be deemed to apply
and to extend to this Act in the same manner as if the
monies borrowed in pursuance of this Act were monies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
borrowed for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the
Metropolis Local Management Acts, or one or more of those
acts. The Board shall apply the monies received by them
under this Act in liquidation of the principal and interest of
the monies so borrowed, but no creditor shall be concerned
to see to such application, or be liable for any misapplication
of the monies received or borrowed by the Board in pursuance
of this Act.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Miscellaneous.</span></h5>

<p>22. Where any chief officer, or other person who has been
employed by the Board in any capacity under this Act, and
has been discharged therefrom, continues to occupy any
house or building that may be provided for his use, or any
part thereof, after one week's notice in writing from the
Board to deliver up possession thereof, it shall be lawful for
any police magistrate, on the oath of one witness, stating
such notice to have been given, by warrant under his hand
to order any constable to enter into the house or building
occupied by such discharged chief officer or other person as
aforesaid, and to remove him and his family and servants
therefrom, and afterwards to deliver the possession thereof
to the Board, as effectually, to all intents and purposes, as
the sheriff having jurisdiction within the place where such
house or building is situate might lawfully do by virtue of a
writ of possession or a judgment at law.</p>

<p>23. If the chimney of any house or other building within
the metropolis is on fire, the occupier of such house or building
shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding twenty shillings;
but if such occupier proves that he has incurred such
penalty by reason of the neglect or wilful default of any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
other person, he may recover summarily from such person
the whole or any part of the penalty he may have incurred
as occupier.</p>

<p>24. All penalties imposed by this Act, or by any byelaw
made in pursuance thereof, and all expenses and other sums
due to the Board in pursuance of this Act, in respect of
which no mode of recovery is prescribed, may be recovered
summarily before two justices in manner directed by the
Act of the session holden in the eleventh and twelfth
years of the reign of her present Majesty, chapter forty-three,
or any Act amending the same, and when so recovered
shall be paid to the treasurer of the Board, notwithstanding
any police act or other act of parliament directing a different
appropriation of such monies.</p>

<p>25. Any dispute or other matter which is by this Act
directed to be determined summarily by two justices shall
be deemed to be a matter in respect of which a complaint is
made upon which they have authority by law to make an
order for payment of money within the meaning of the said
Act of the session holden in the eleventh and twelfth years
of the reign of her present Majesty, chapter forty-three,
or any Act amending the same.</p>

<p>26. Any act, power, or jurisdiction hereby authorized to
be done or exercised by two justices may be done or exercised
by the following magistrates within their respective
jurisdictions; that is to say, by any metropolitan police
magistrate sitting alone at a police court or other appointed
place, or by the Lord Mayor of the City of London, or any
alderman of the said City, sitting alone or with others at the
Mansion House or Guildhall.</p>

<p>27. The accounts of the Board in respect of expenses incurred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
by them under this Act shall be audited in the same
manner as if they were expenses incurred under the said
Metropolis Local Management Acts, and the Board shall in
each year make a report to one of her Majesty's principal
Secretaries of State of all acts done and expenditure incurred
by them in pursuance of this Act, and that report shall be
laid before Parliament within one month after the commencement
of the session.</p>

<p>28. The Board may delegate any powers conferred on
them by this Act to a committee of their body; and such
committee shall, to the extent to which such powers are
delegated, be deemed to be the Board within the meaning of
this Act.</p>

<p>29. If the companies insuring property within the metropolis,
or any such number of them as may in the opinion
of the said Board be sufficient, establish a force of men
charged with the duty of attending at fires and saving insured
property, it shall be the duty of the Fire Brigade,
with the sanction of the Board, and subject to any regulations
that may be made by the Board, to afford the necessary
assistance to that force in the performance of their duties,
and, upon the application of any officer of that force, to hand
over to their custody property that may be saved from fire;
and no charge shall be made by the said Board for the services
thus rendered by the fire brigade.</p>

<p>30. It shall be lawful for the Board, when occasion requires,
to permit any part of the fire brigade establishment,
with their engines, escapes, and other implements, to proceed
beyond the limits of the metropolis for the purpose of
extinguishing fires. In such case the owner and occupier
of the property where the fire has occurred shall be jointly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and severally liable to defray all the expenses that may be
incurred by the Fire Brigade in attending the fire, and
shall pay to the Board a reasonable charge for the attendance
of the Fire Brigade, and the use of their engines, escapes,
and other implements. In case of difference between the
Board and the owner and occupier of such property, or
either of them, the amount of the expenses, as well as the
propriety of the Fire Brigade attending such fire (if the
propriety thereof be disputed), shall be summarily determined
by two justices. In default of payment, any expenses under
this section may be recovered by the Board in a summary
manner.</p>

<p>The Board may also permit any part of the Fire Brigade
Establishment to be employed on special services upon such
terms of remuneration as the said Board may think just.</p>

<p>31. The Metropolitan Fire Brigade shall in the morning
of each day, with the exception of Sundays, send information,
by post or otherwise, to all the insurance offices contributing
for the purposes of this Act, of all fires which have
taken place within the metropolis since the preceding return,
in such form as may be agreed upon between the Board
and the said companies.</p>

<p>32. All the powers now exercised by any local body or
officer within the metropolis as respects fireplugs shall
henceforth be exercised by the Board, and the Board shall be
entitled to receive copies or extracts of all plans kept by any
water company under the provision of the Act of the session
of the fifteenth and sixteenth years of her Majesty,
chapter eighty-four; and every such water company shall
provide at the expense of the Board in any mains or pipes
within the metropolis plugs for the supply of water in case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of fire at such places, of such dimensions, and in such form
as the Board may require, and the Fire Brigade shall be at
liberty to make such use thereof as they may deem necessary
for the purpose of extinguishing any fire; and every such
company shall deposit keys of all their fireplugs at such
places as may be appointed by the Board, and the Board may
put up on any house or building a public notice in some conspicuous
place in each street in which a fireplug is situated,
showing its situation.</p>

<p>33. "Owner" in this Act shall mean the person for the
time being receiving the rackrent of the premises in connexion
with which the word is used, either on his own
account or as agent or trustee for some other person, or who
would receive the same if the premises were let at rackrent.</p>


<h5><i>Repeal.</i></h5>

<p>34. On and after the first day of January, one thousand
eight hundred and sixty-six, there shall be repealed so much
as is unrepealed of an Act passed in the fourteenth year of
his late Majesty King George the Third, chapter seventy-eight,
and intituled an Act for the further and better regulation
of buildings and party walls, and for the more
effectually preventing mischief by fire, within the Cities of
London and Westminster and the liberties thereof, and
other the parishes, precincts, and places within the weekly
bills of mortality, the parishes of St. Marylebone, Paddington,
St. Pancras, and St. Luke, at Chelsea, in the
County of Middlesex, and for indemnifying, under certain
conditions, builders and other persons against the penalties
to which they are or may be liable for erecting buildings
within the limits aforesaid contrary to law, with the exception<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of sections eighty-three and eighty-six which
shall remain in full force, but such repeal shall not affect
any penalty or liability incurred under the repealed
sections.</p>

<p>35. On and after the first day of January, one thousand
eight hundred and sixty-six, section forty-four of an Act
passed in the session holden in the third and fourth years of
the reign of King William the Fourth, chapter ninety,
shall be repealed so far as respects any parish or place
within the limits of the metropolis as defined by this Act;
provided that the repeal of the said section shall not affect the
power of the churchwardens and overseers of any parish or
place to contribute to the funds of any society that at the
time of the passing of this Act maintains fire escapes in
such parish or place, unless and until the Board purchase
the property of such society, or otherwise provide fire
escapes in such parish or place.</p></div>
